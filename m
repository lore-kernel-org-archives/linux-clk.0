Subject: [PATCH 0/3] clk: sunxi-ng: sun6i-a31: Register offset and clk flag fixes
Date: Thu, 15 Sep 2016 14:57:37 +0800

Hi,

Here are 3 fixes for the new sunxi-ng clk driver for sun6i-a31 recently
introduced for 4.9. The issues were noticed while working on the display
pipeline for the A31/A31s. The second patch follows what Maxime has done
for the A33 CCU driver. The third issue was noticed while doing the first
patch.

I hope we can get this into 4.9 as well, either right in -rc1, or in a
later -rc.

Thanks!

Regards
ChenYu

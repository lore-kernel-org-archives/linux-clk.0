Yes. I've tagged this patch as applicable on stable 4.1 in case it
didn't make it in the next -rc (which should be the last one before
4.1 is released).
I don't know if it's a good practice, but I've had several fixes which
missed the targeted release in the past, and tagging them as stable
helps in getting the patches applied afterwards.

Oops, I mixed the commit hash in my local branch and the one in clk-next
(4d52b2acefdfceae0e47ed08324a96f511dc80b1).

Best Regards,

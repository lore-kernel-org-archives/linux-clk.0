I also prefer multiplier over factor.

Jim Quinlan submitted a similar patch. See here:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-clk/msg00691.html

I nacked that patch because Stephen and I are trying to figure out how
the basic clock types should work going forward. Code reuse is good, but
they are not very maintainable.

Since there are two potential users of this code, I should reconsider.
Can you two come up with a common implementation that works for both of
you?  Please do not put any CLK_OF_DECLARE stuff in there (there isn't
any now, but I wanted to be clear).

Mike

I have the same issue ;)

You did not miss anything. I understand your choice.
I just have different approach and usually prefer to avoid these particularity
which may catch you later on. 

At least, the fact that propagation would stop with CLK_DIVIDER_READ_ONLY on
LPC32xx, even with CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT, is now known.

Adding a comment in the code to make this explicit would be nice though.

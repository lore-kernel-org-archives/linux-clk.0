#reset-cells: Should be 2 if compatilbe string is "hisilicon,hi3519-crg". Should be 3 otherwise.
	      A reset signal can be controlled by writing a bit register in the CRG module.
	      The reset specifier consists of two or three cells. The first cell represents the
	      register offset relative to the base address. The second cell represents the
	      bit index in the register.The third cell represents the polarity of the reset
	      line (0 for active-high, 1 for active-low).

If I change the binding like this, can it be accepted?

Jiancheng

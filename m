This seems a little too magical. The omission of an id in an
array of clks would mean that only that one clk is acquired
through of_clk_get(). We could have a mixture of ids and no ids
for some device, and then do very odd things.

How about we add a flag to clk_bulk_data that indicates we want
it to use of_clk_get() instead of clk_get() for all of the clks?
Then the id is ignored for the entire function.

Also, this patch needs to document the new behavior somewhere in
the kernel-doc for this function.

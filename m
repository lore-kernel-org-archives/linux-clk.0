The WKUP pin can be configured from the shdwc driver, ACC_CE from the
ACC driver, RXLP_MCE, from the RXLP driver because you will need
drivers for those at some point anyway.

Well, we don't really care about the mechanism. We only care about how
the user is able to configure the wakeup sources.

With your patch set, what happens when no ULP1 sources are defined but
there are ULP0 sources? What happens when there are both ULP1 and ULP0
sources?

What would be good is to use ULP1 when only ULP1 sources are set up and
ULP0 in the other cases. This will greatly help the user. Also, what I'm
suggesting actually allows to change the ULP1 sources at runtime from
devices that are actually used which is quite better than setting them
up statically from DT.

Well, you could do few things.

- You can use clk_ignore_unused cmdline option between patch #8 and #9 
and it should work, but will most likely break PM.
- You can introduce the DTS changes on a clkctrl module basis, e.g. 
introduce the node for l4_per_clkctrl along with the clock node changes 
for the same
- Do some sort of split between DTS / vs. clkctrl data introduction 
within the clock driver, this forces the files to be in sync with each 
other though.
- Try parsing the DTs for matching clock handles while registering DT 
clocks, if not found, toss our a pr_warn and skip registering the clock. 
Will be very ineffective though as one needs to parse the whole DTS to 
find the clock entries. This clock parsing could be dropped later.

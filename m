Actually, now that I've thought about it some more. It probably
makes more sense to make all of the "davinci_nand" devices in this
series use id = -1 since there is only one per board. It looks like
da850 is the only one that has a lookup for "davinic_nand.0" already.

I think that we are going to have to add clock lookups for the
"davinci_nand" devices as well. Although the driver doesn't do
clk_get() explicitly, I think some function it calls does get a
clock. I remember that we had to add a clock-ranges property to
device tree to get the davinci_nand driver working, which is why
I think we are going to need a clock lookup for these devices
as well.

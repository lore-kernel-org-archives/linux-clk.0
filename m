Almost. Part of the call to drm_mode_config_create_initial_state() if
needed to make it grab its resources. See atomic_install_state in that
series. So probe wouldn't have anything more to do.

Why do you think it's orthogonal? It would completely fix your problem.

It's likely to be merged in the next few weeks.

I mean, yeah, but the good thing is that you only have one driver to
care about, right?

At the expense of exposing an unsafe function for only a single user and
usecase.

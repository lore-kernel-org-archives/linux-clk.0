I see. So for the current in kernel users, none would be able to
hit the fractional mode clock rates. HDMI on sun5i is limited to
1080p60, and we don't support pixel doubling. LCD dotclocks have
a minimal /6 divider, though it doesn't seem likely they will hit
this either, or we would have seen someone complain. And these
drivers were introduced well before 4.13-rc1. The clk maintainers
really like to have just critical fixes, and fixes for stuff
added in the current release. So I'm re-queuing these 4 patches
for 4.14.

Thanks

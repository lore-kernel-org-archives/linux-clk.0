Short answer is they don't. I'd still prefer we have this API though.

Can you rework this patch to be a little more invasive into the
clk_get() path, perhaps by reworking __of_clk_get_by_name() a little to
take an 'optional' argument, so that it only returns NULL when the clk
is looked up from DT? The fallback path in clkdev where we have a DT
based system looking up a clk through clkdev lookups doesn't seem to be
a real scenario that we should worry about here. I think sometimes
people use clkdev lookups when they're migrating to DT systems and
things aren't wired up properly in DT, but that isn't the norm.

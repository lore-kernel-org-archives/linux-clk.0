Fair enough. But the situation I had on my platform is that it provides
DVFS support for 2 CPU clusters and 1 GPU domain. I didn't want to block
using CPUFreq until GPU DVFS was properly supported in the firmware.
I had similar situation with the clock and hence I allowed it to continue.

Not exactly, what if the error is for that particular clock. That's my
point. If we have reached so far means the communication is fine. Just a
fault piece of hardware which may not be critical.

Not sure, I am not registering the clock. Think SCPI as a single clock
provider with multiple clock outputs. You don't want to disable it
entirely if one of the clock outputs have problem. That's my counter
argument.

Not sure how if we are not registering that clock output from the h/w
clock provider perspective.

Yes, I agree the above is not entirely acceptable situation.

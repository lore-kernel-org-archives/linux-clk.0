Just noticed this patch set.

One of clock-controller blocks (CCU) on lpc18xx has a similar
requirement. The CCU is clock fanout block with gates and the gate
registers can not be accessed if the base (parent) clock for the gate
is not running. Doing so causes the cpu to wedge.

The workaround I have locally is to check in the is_enabled gate op if
the parent is running or not. This works fine, but I am all for a more
generic solution in the clk framework.

I'll see if I can find the time to test your patch set. Thanks for
working on this.

Joachim Eastwood

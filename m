Then maybe we just need a NMP clock type then. What I'm really afraid
of is that we'll just end up in a clk-factors situation that was
simply impossible to maintain without breaking anything, hence why we
had different clock types then.

Every addition we made was only needed by one instance at first :)

We are working that way for fixed pre-dividers already, I don't see
why we can't have it for variable ones too.

I think it would be a great start yes. I'll try to discuss it with
Mike and Stephen at ELC and see what they think about that.

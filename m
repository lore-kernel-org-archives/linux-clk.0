I understand your point, but core frame-work changes
need more careful review than clk data changes in low-level drivers.
It is too late to be included in v4.10.

If I drop 32bit SoC things, and send v2 only for 64bit SoCs,
is that acceptable for 4.10-rc1?

Our ARMv8 SoCs are more actively developed, so
getting 64bit clk data in first will be helpful.

I postpone the 32bit SoC data until
I figure out the root cause of the problem
(and possible change for the API if necessary).

There's a variable length array in here, causing sparse to
complain:

	drivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2835.c:1408:41:
	warning: Variable length array is used.

This one looks easy enough to fix with another allocation.

But then there's some weird casting warning coming from sparse
that I honestly don't understand:

drivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2835.c:370:36:
warning: cast truncates bits from constant value (3fffffffff8000
becomes ffff8000)
drivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2835.c:372:19:
warning: cast truncates bits from constant value (3ffffffff80
becomes ffffff80)
drivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2835.c:378:37:
warning: cast truncates bits from constant value (fffffffff80000
becomes fff80000)
drivers/clk/bcm/clk-bcm2835.c:380:42:
warning: cast truncates bits from constant value (1fffffffff
becomes ffffffff)

I guess I'll just ignore that for now. A couple nitpicks are
left, but nothing major.

Drop the parenthesis here.

Didn't notice this one before. Why not add the LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS to
start, and then call ktime_get() in the loop and use
ktime_after() to figure out if we're beyond the timeout?

devm_clk_register?

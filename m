Hi Michael,

I am back after long pause.

I noticed a conflict between two of your requests.

If I have CLK_UNIPHIER selected by ARCH_UNIPHIER,
it is impossible to add "depends on COMPILE_TEST".


I see some drivers that have "depends on ARCH_<SOC> || COMPILE_TEST"
as follows:


config COMMON_CLK_HI6220
        bool "Hi6220 Clock Driver"
        depends on ARCH_HISI || COMPILE_TEST

config COMMON_CLK_QCOM
        tristate "Support for Qualcomm's clock controllers"
        depends on OF
        depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST


I think the style above works fine with COMPILE_TEST.


But, if we make it a non-visible config option selected by ARCH,
how can COMPILE_TEST select it?


config COMMON_CLK_HI6220
        bool
        prompt "Hi6220 Clock Driver" if COMPILE_TEST

should work, but looks a bit tricky.   Hmm...

OK, will add a binding document in the next version.

I do not intend to add clock-output-names in my device trees.

of_clk_get_parent_name() tries best to take the parent name via
of_clk_get_from_provider() if clock-output-names is missing.
I wanted to use this feature.

No problem, but not 100% happy.

If we allow to hardcode the parent name strings,
"clock-names" and "clocks" properties are useless in clock-cascading.

Like IRQ controllers can be cascaded by "interrupts" chain,
I want to describe the hierarchy of clock-providers
without hard-coding the detail of parent.

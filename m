It may be unpolite to say that, but I just want a working A64 mainline kernel at first.
I'm trying to submit the drivers of the changed IP blocks now, but it's a pity that I
cannot submit the DT patches now.
clock-ng is at least now a usable solution.
Or can you work out such a firmware-based clock driver as soon as possible?

I'm expecting your SCPI-based driver!
(ARM is now such a mess that it really needs a standard.)

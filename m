I found that remark interesting, and agree here with Stephen, critical
clks should be already on and everything else should be controlled from
drivers.

With that in mind I went on and looked again what is currently (after
the parents enable patchset) still wrong on i.MX 7. Turned out to be not
that much, and I think it should be fixable with that:

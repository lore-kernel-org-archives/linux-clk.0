No, the DSP clock is programmed using configuration parameters which are
sent from driver. DSP doesn't have any mechanism to report the clock
configuration back to driver. So the rate is cached.

Yes, this behavior is applicable for this driver. I will remove the
recalculation part and resubmit the patch by returning the cached rate
already done in set_rate.

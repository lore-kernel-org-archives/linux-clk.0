I will give it a try.

But to me it seems as if the disabling of PLLD produces a hickup in the 
firmware (which relies on PLLD-DIV and thus PLL).

This would also explain the 3-4 second bar/blanking pattern seen on HDMI,
which I would guess is related to a reset loop...

I got a simple fix for now, that just prepares a few clocks/pll/pll_divs
during probing, so that they will never get unprepared/fully stopped):

And that resolves the issue and also allows loading/unloading of the
amba-pl011 module as well without any hickups.

I guess it would be better if we did make this configurable in the DT.
(See patch 1 of my RFC patchset, which could get extended to handle this
as well - at least a portion thereof).

But in more general terms: we need to come up with some agreement
on ownership of the clocks between linux and the firmware and how
to change them without impacting the other. 

One example is the “overclocking” that currently happens for
downstream kernels in the firmware, which impacts some of the
plls and PLLdivs as well as the sram control registers.

The reason for this seems to be that for overclocking the SRAM
parameters also need to get changed and that can only get done
reliably when running the code from L1/L2 caches - and that
requirement of not touching SRAM while changing the SRAM parameters
is probably hard to achieve cleanly on ARM alone.

Ciao,

P.s: unloading amba_pl011 gives the following error:
root@raspcm:~# rmmod amba_pl011
[  142.318263] Trying to free nonexistent resource <0000000020201000-0000000020201fff>
but that is an issue not related to clock...

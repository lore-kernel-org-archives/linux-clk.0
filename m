But we can't figure out if the clk is already running when we
probe this driver, correct? It seems that we're relying on
knowing if the clk is already running by looking at the software
enable count that relates to if the clk is enabled in software by
some linux consumer.

recalc_rate() is called whenever the clk rate could change. It
could be that clk_set_rate() is called directly on this clk, and
then recalc_rate() would be called. Or it could be that the
parent of this clk has its rate change, and then again
recalc_rate() would be called on this clk. set_parent is about
changing the parent of the clk, which also would cause the
framework to call recalc_rate() on a clk that gets a new parent.

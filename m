In this case you're right, and we should change them to lib-y in
the Makefile and then let the linker figure this all out. No more
dependency patches. I think we only need to do this sort of
Kconfig stuff when we want to make a library .ko file that each
SoC specific driver depends on for common code.

It would be cool if the build system could figure that all out
for us, and let us have something like modlib-y that makes it a
library (archive) if all objects depending on it are builtin and
we have CONFIG_MODULES=n, or makes it into an object file if
something is builtin that depends on it, or makes it into a
module if everything that depends on it is a module.

I can't say that's absolutely true (wink).

The simplefb bindings takes clocks and regulators expressly for the
purpose of keeping them enabled.

Yes.

As it owns the whole CCU unit, why not? And how would it know if some
clock is referenced or not, unless going through the whole device tree?

Furthermore, nothing prevents another device driver from referencing
said clock and turning it off when it's not in use. Think THS driver
with runtime PM.

Are you also mapping the THS to secure only? Otherwise nothing would
prevent Linux from also claiming it.

If you want a clock to not be disabled by anyone, adding CLK_IS_CRITICAL
to its flags is the proper option. This is done in the clk driver though.

If you just don't want the clk subsystem to disable unused clks at boot
time, you can add "clk_ignore_unused" to the kernel boot parameters.
I think this is more of a hack and debugging tool though.

About dummy drivers, simplefb comes to mind again. But simplefb disables
them when it gets kicked out by the drm driver. Maybe there are other
examples.

Thanks for the review, much appreciated.

from a hardware perspective these clocks are pretty much stand-alone and 
independent, there is no real parent/child dependency I can think of and 
having this as 'floating' isn't very far from reality.

it's not clear to me what cross-platform goals you are hinting at and 
what the concern is. We can add more framework stuff and make the code 
more elegant but at the end of the day we will write in a very limited 
set of registers (2 for audio - on/off and 19.2/25MHz selection) and the 
use of this functionality is restricted to Baytrail and Cherrytrail.

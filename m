Thanks.

Looks like a different route and I know why. I have added an extra check
now which should work if I have not missed anything more.

No problem, as I said I am fine with the patch you sent as a fix for now
but just curious to know what are the issues to be fixed to continue
supporting that feature. Please bear with me.

I would have agreed if it was single driver or h/w controlled by Linux.
Since it's in the firmware, we should allow the working clocks/opps to
work though few are broken. It's not good if we had to disable
everything if some piece of firmware is not yet ready or broken.
But again, we can get it working later, for now, I am fine with you patch.

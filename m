I guess I find the outphasing degrees not being increasing somewhat
odd...

I had a hard time wrapping this around my head when I was working on
the MMC DDR stuff. Allwinner's code directly asks for a delay, not a
outphasing. I just checked and it seems I converted some values
incorrectly. I need to do some more tests for the A80...

Thanks for the explanation.

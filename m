This should prevent from modifying parent clock.
But my problem was different.
On A20, gpu_clk can have different PLL,
not I've found out the way to choose right one
with assigned-parent-clocks.

I have patchset ready for adding A20 mali node,
but I need some more time to complete with OPP,
then I will submit entire patchset.
Now it works correctly, using right pll(dedicated PLL8),
setting right frequency.

Btw, do I need to add a board using it,
or can I add only Mali node to sun7i-a20.dtsi(plus other little patches)?

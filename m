Isn't this handled by the following commit?

commit 2e603ad98460fd0efab71e618d49a2ffc9aef67b

    ARM: i.MX6: clk: add i.MX6 DualLite differences

    The CCM_CBCMR register (address 0x02C4018) has different meaning
    between the i.MX6 Quad/Dual and the i.MX6 Solo/DualLite.

    Compared to the i.MX6 Quad/Dual, the CCM_CBCMR register in the
    i.MX6 Solo/DualLite doesn't have a gpu3d_shader configuration and
    moves the gpu2_core configuration at that place.

    Handle these i.MX6 Quad/Dual vs. i.MX6 Solo/DualLite clock differences
    by using cpu_is_mx6dl().

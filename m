Sorry for not answering about this series before but I've been in contact
with Tomeu over IRC before he posted it and since you already added your
Reviewed-by tag, I didn't feel the need do to it.

This is a regression for 4.3 since S2R was working correctly for 4.2 in
Snow, I tested after fixing resume with commit 6fd4899a54a5 ("irqchip:
exynos-combiner: Save IRQ enable set on suspend") and the display was
always enabled on resume.

I don't have access to a Snow anymore to bisect but I think the regression
was introduced by some of the changes in 4.3 to migrate the Exynos DRM to
Atomic Mode Settings. But probably that just exposed a latent bug and it
was working out of luck since I had the same issue than Tomeu in Exynos5420
and was fixed in the same way with commits:

885601002998 ("clk: exynos5420: Add IDs for clocks used in DISP1 power domain")
ea08de16eb1b ("ARM: dts: Add DISP1 power domain for exynos5420")

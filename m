Could detail a bit more why you chose to represent this flexcom IP as
a clock device ?

I don't like to use this 'DT should represent real hardware' argument,
but to me, it looks like you're trying to use a false hardware
representation to avoid changing the peripheral drivers code, which is
wrong since the DT is supposed to represent the hardware blocks.

How about representing the flexcom as an MFD instead ?

Best Regards,

Boris

There are many reasons why it can be hard to change a DT binary or source
file later on. Sometimes the dtb is shipped with the firmware, sometimes
someone has a slightly different platform that is not yet upstreamed,
and they need to know about the change when forward-porting to a newer
kernel.

Either way, you always want to be able to run a newer kernel on an older
dtb file without loss of functionality, so all "compatible" strings should
generally be as specific as possible (with fallbacks to more generic
strings). We do this even for devices that we think are identical, e.g.
when multiple SoC vendors integrate the same IP block, but in this case,
we already *know* that they are incompatible, so we should never have
the same string as the most specific ID.

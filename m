there's no clock controller at 0xea0000 with so big size. In BG4CT, we have
the following different kind of plls/clks

1. cpupll/syspll/mempll: the same IP, the pll register is put with the user
together, plus one shared bypass control register. For example: mempll register
is put with DDR controller registers together. cpupll, syspll and mempll share
the same bypass register: 0xea0710. 

2. gateclks: the clk can only be enabled or disabled, the control bits are put
into one(or two) register(s)

3. clks: can be disabled/enabled, change the divider, etc.. all these clks
registers are put together. In this register space, some space may not be used.


[PATCH 5/5] shows the layout of the clk/pll registers

Is there any existing clk drivers switched to this type. I'll grep and
take that for an example.

Could you please kindly give advice about how to avoid the splitting?

Thanks a lot for review,

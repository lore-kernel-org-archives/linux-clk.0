Ok. So perhaps just the mpll fix would be appropriate then?

I agree they're simple and safe, but they're also not necessary
to the release we're working on unless they're causing some
problem with code that was introduced this merge window. We try
to avoid merging non-critical fixes unless they're really causing
someone some sort of problems. If they aren't, we can stick them
into linux-next and wait until next release. Of course, they'll
be backported to stable trees as well with the Fixes tag, so
everything works out in the end.

Yeah that's needed to get the interconnect hierarchy right for
genpd :)

No let's not drop the clockdomains as those will be needed when we
move things into proper hierarchy within the interconnect instances.
This will then help with getting things right with genpd.

In the long run we just want to specify clockdomain and the offset of
the clock instance within the clockdomain in the dts files.

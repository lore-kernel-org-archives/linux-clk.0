Right now, I'm using the clk-divider driver (integer divider).
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/clk/clk-tango4.c

I was trying to avoid writing any code, but it looks like I would
need a specific driver if I want to support the hardware's fractional
divider logic.

Once I started looking at the HW API, I was thinking that it
could be improved (and perhaps the HW engineers would agree
to make the change) but I wanted to get feedback from seasoned
devs with respect to the proposed HW API.

So, do you agree that

  DIV = 2^I * (1 + F/256)

gives a more useful DIV distribution than

  DIV = I + F/16

I'm not sure how to parse that. I'm using the divider driver
for a CPU clock, to do D(V)FS in cpufreq.

Sorry for the slow response, but my previous comment on that block of
code was regarding the values not matching the values to the fields in
the struct. For example, in "7 << 19", what do 7 and 19 represent? That
could be documented by e.g.:

#define FOO_MASK 7
#define FOO_SHIFT 19

where FOO is the name of the field, and would tie the values into the
documentation (assuming there is some)

Of course at this stage it's fine to change this later.

Just to be simple:
Why do you have to modify existing clk-fractional-divider.c module?

May I suggest to reconsider your design to be fit in the existing CLK
divider implementations? Also, some of the hardware IPs have inside
divider registers, like mentioned above UARTs. I already suggested to
look at them to see how hardware is done.

Again, (actually I bored to repeat) I didn't see (yet!) any HW divider
which has integer part as 2^I. I don't get why you stuck with that
formula and why 1/256? Who prevents to have 1/32768 in HW (like we have
in LPSS of Intel SoCs)?

Here I'm giving up this discussion. Perhaps more experienced people
could correct me.

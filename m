right, the relevant divider operations were copied, however the difference
is important, unfortunately there is no simple option to get rid of regmap,
because System Control Block registers are shared with a number of other
device drivers.

The driver supports CLK_DIVIDER_READ_ONLY clocks, and it should not be
changed, but all such clocks don't have children with CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT
property, which invalidates your fix for LPC32xx. Please let me know,
if I missed something.

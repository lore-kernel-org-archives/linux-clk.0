Subject: [PATCH] clk: sunxi-ng: enable so-said LDOs for A33 SoC's pll-mipi clock
Date: Fri, 18 Nov 2016 00:49:54 +0800
Message-Id: <20161117164954.62658-1-icenowy@aosc.xyz>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

In the user manual of A33 SoC, the bit 22 and 23 of pll-mipi control
register is called "LDO{1,2}_EN", and according to the BSP source code
from Allwinner [1], the LDOs are enabled during the clock's enabling
process.

The clock failed to generate output if the two LDOs are not enabled.

Add the two bits to the clock's gate bits, so that the LDOs are enabled
when the PLL is enabled.

Dear Chen-Yu:
As you said, the two bits are also present in the CCU of A23 and A31.
Could you please check whether the PLL works on the two SoCs?
I remembered you mentioned you failed to make TCON enabled on A23.
On A31, you may hack the parent of tcon-ch0 to force the tcon clock to
use pll-mipi as parent, in order to check whether the pll works.

However, I didn't found the code that enables the LDOs in the BSP A23/31
sources, so you must test them to ensure whether the code is needed for
these SoCs.

Regards,
Icenowy

Patches look mostly ok to me, but this certainly feels like some
generic problem that we should handle in the core. Perhaps it
would make sense to move this over to using the handoff mechanism
Mike is working on, where we keep the clock on until a consumer
grabs a reference to the clock?

So I'm not opposed to merging this for 4.4, but I'd like to see
it become a generic solution sometime soon, instead of staying as
a one-off fix for imx platforms.

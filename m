All current dts files in the kernel tree have 1MHz on input 1, so we 
make this change here to set the parent to input 1 if there isn't an 
assigned-clock-parents property. Presumably new dts files should have 
the new property so that things work properly. I tried to find the 
binding document, but it doesn't look to exist, so I didn't have 
anything to update.

Hi Rob, Stephen,

Thanks for your feedback, but on these Amlogic platforms, the AO register bank is
filled with interleaved registers used for various purposes.

For instance, the first 1k of registers are :

0-c RTI_STATUS
c-14 RTI_PWR_CNTL
14-1c PIN_MUX
1c RTI_STATUS
24-30 GPIO
30 JTAG_CONFIG
34 WD
38-40 CPU_CTRL
40 RTI_GEN_CTRL
44 CPU_CTRL
4c-58 TIMER
58 OSCIN
60 AHB2DDR
...


And so on, and the clock related registers are split among this space.

For sure, this could be declared as an system controller node, but this would imply completely
re-designing the actual clock driver and drop the actual bindings.
(and with re-writting the clock gate code to use regmap registers access)

Anyway, I'm open to suggestions...

Neil

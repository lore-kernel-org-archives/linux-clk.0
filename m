Yes, my point was that this may not be the case in all systems. IOW the
framework should be generic enough to allow hierarchies where a parent
clock is a clock provided by a different controller from a different HW.

Is safe if the clock controllers are always aquired in the same order but
I'm not sure if that will always be the case. I.e: you have controllers A
and B that have clocks A{1,2} and B{1,2} respectively. So you could have
something like this:

A1 with parent B1
B2 with parent A2

That can cause a deadlock since in the first case, the controller A will be
aquired and then the controller B but in the other case, the opposite order
will be attempted.

Yes, splitting the lock per controller will fix the possible deadlock in
this case but I think we need an approach that is safe for all possible
scenarios. Otherwise it will work more by coincidence than due a design.

Other thing to figure out is how to determine when a parent belongs to a
different controller to get its lock in clk_{prepare,enable}(), at least
part of the hierarchy has to be traversed on prepare/enable to propagate
the operations to the parents clocks.

Yes, I meant the issue of having a shared parent in general and not in this
particular case that no parent is shared. Sorry for the ambiguous sentence.

So in summary, my point is that we should first define what these locks are
protecting. The good practice in the kernel is to protect data structures
instead of code, but the prepare and enable locks are not doing the former.

My understanding is that what the locks are protecting is a sub-tree of the
hierarchy but there isn't a data structure to represent a sub-tree so global
locks are used to protect the whole tree instead.

Moving the lock to a per controller/provider seems like an arbitrary thing
to me since what's important AFAIU is the clock hierarchy and not from where
these clocks come from.

But I'm very far from being a lock expert so maybe my assumptions are wrong,
I'll let Stephen and Mike to comment on this.

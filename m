The problem is that it encourages the use of of_clk_get() when
clk_get() is more desirable. Ideally of_clk_get() is never used
when a device exists. In this case, it seems like we need to
support it though, hence the suggestion of having a
devm_get_clk_from_child() API, that explicitly reads as "get a
clock from a child node of this device". The distinction is
important, because of_clk_get() should rarely be used.

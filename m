well, it's a compatible API change. So if you continue to use it as you
were obliged to do before, everything is fine. IMHO the introduction of
per-user clocks are a much bigger issue.

I'm not sure that auto disabling is a good idea[1], but at least giving a
warning should be possible.

You mean clk_disable_unprepare is called in the same function that calls
clk_put I assume such that you don't have to do anything in the exit
path.

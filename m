Subject: [PATCH 08/10] ARM: sun8i: h3: add operating-points-v2 table for CPU
Date: Sun, 23 Jul 2017 18:27:47 +0800
Message-Id: <20170723102749.17323-9-icenowy@aosc.io>

The CPU on Allwinner H3 can do dynamic frequency scaling.

Add a DVFS table based on the one tweaked by Armbian developers, which
are proven to work stably on BSP kernels.

Frequencies higher than 1008MHz are temporarily dropped in the table, as
they may lead to over voltage on boards without proper regulator
settings or over temperature on boards with proper regulator settings.
They will be added back once regulator settings are ready and thermal
sensor driver is merged.

In order to satisfy all different regulators (SY8106A which is 50mV per
level, SY8113B which have two states: 1.1V and 1.3V, and some board with
non-tweakable regulators), all the OPPs are defined with a range which has
the target value as the minimum allowed value, and 1.3V (the highest
VDD-CPUX voltage suggested by the datasheet) as the maximum allowed value.
It's proven to work well with a board with SY8113B.

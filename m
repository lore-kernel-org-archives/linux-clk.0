Several people who have seen this patch have expressed concern that a
1.2 ms delay is pretty long for something that's supposed to be
"atomic" like a clk_enable().  Consider that someone might call
clk_enable() while interrupts are disabled and that a 1.2 ms interrupt
latency is not so great.

It seems like this clock should be moved to be enabled in "prepare"
and the "enable" should be a no-op.  This is a functionality change,
but I don't think there are any real users for this clock at the
moment so it should be fine.

(of course, the 1 ms latency that existed before this patch was still
pretty bad, but ...)

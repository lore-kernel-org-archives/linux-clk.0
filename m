With the series "[PATCH v9 0/5] Add runtime PM support for clocks (on Exynos
SoC example)", runtime support is added in the common clock framework. This
is expected to be merged to clk-next after -rc1 drop. 

Reference: http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-clk/msg19755.html

So marking the parent clock with skylake device will help keep the DSP
active on call to enable clock.

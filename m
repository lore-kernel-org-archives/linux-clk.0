For now, mixer index is important only for determining CCSC base in conjuction 
with VEP capability. Obviously, I can't exclude that there is some other case 
where that mixer index is needed.

Can't we just add reg property for that?

V3s mixer has 2 VI channels and others have 1.

(Channel is better term, since is used throughout BSP code)

For now, most SoCs (I didn't check all) have 3 UI channels on first mixer and 1 
UI channel on second mixer. Except V3s, which have only one mixer with 1 UI 
channel.

Again, V3s is exception here. Scaler is not supported on UI channel, but other 
SoCs have scalers on all channels.

Disclaimer: I didn't check DE2 capabilities of all SoCs, only few populars.

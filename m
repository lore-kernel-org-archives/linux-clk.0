This is not an option. The CCM holds a reference to those clocks,
specifically to prevent them from being disabled before a real serial
driver is bound. If this isn't done you might end up in a situation
where PM or driver probe deferal disables the UART clock/the parent of
this clock, even if it was previously enabled by the bootloader. With
earlycon this might lead to a full system hang at this point, when
earlycon tries to access a clock gated UART.

ok :-D

I gave this a spin on my rk3288-firefly board. It still boots, the clock tree 
looks the same and it also still defers nicely in the scenario I needed it 
for. The implementation also looks nice - and of course much more compact than 
my check in two places :-) . I don't know if you want to put this as follow-up 
on top or fold it into the original orphan-check, so in any case

Not sure I understand this correctly yet, but when these children get 
orphaned, switched to the clk_nodrv_ops, they won't get their original ops 
back if the parent reappears.

So I guess we would need to store the original ops in secondary property of 
struct clk_core and I guess simply bind the ops-switch to the orphan state 
update?

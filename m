For clock related properties in the device tree:

&tcon_top {
    clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_TCON_TOP>,
             <&ccu CLK_TCON_TV0>,
             <&tve0>,
             <&ccu CLK_TCON_TV1>,
             <&tve1>;
    clock-names = "bus", "tcon-tv0", "tve0", "tcon-tv1", "tve1";
    clock-output-names = "tcon-top-tv0", "tcon-top-tv1";
};

&tcon_tv0 {
    clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_TCON_TV0>, <&tcon_top 0>'
    clock-names = "ahb", "tcon-ch1";
};

A diagram would look like:

                   | This part is TCON TOP |
                   v                       v
CCU CLK_TCON_TV0 --|----\                  |
                   |     mux ---- gate ----|-- TCON_TV0
TVE0 --------------|----/                  |

And the same goes for TCON_TV1 and TVE1.

The user manual is a bit lacking on how TVE outputs a clock though.

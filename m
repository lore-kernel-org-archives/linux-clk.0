Ok. So the simplest fix is to just do this? I'll write up some
commit text and get this into the rc.

Maybe we should change of_clk_get_parent_count() to return an
unsigned int as well. I'm not sure why anyone would care whether
or not a node has "clocks" or not as a property. It seems that
all the callers of this function want to know how many parents
there are. In fact, some TI drivers assign the return value from
this function directly to clk_init_data::num_parents which is an
unsigned value. That's horribly broken if there isn't a proper DT
node.

So how about we apply this patch for the next release? We could
also change the return type to unsigned so that people don't get
the wrong idea. That type of change will be a bit larger though
because we'll have to remove impossible < 0 checks in drivers;
not a huge deal but slightly annoying. I can do that legwork
tomorrow.

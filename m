It is a bug, but it is better than a crash that happens currently
because of a stopped clock.
Also there is a proposed way forward when hand-off
becomes available.

This happens for both upstream and downstream when using
cprman...

You remember the main-uart crashing discussion (when 
loaded as a module or not used as the kernel console?) it is
exactly what an unclaimed clock is triggering when the clock
Is prepared/enabled and then released.

I have also seen the same issue happen with PCM without
the patch - as soon as we request a frequency which will use
pllc/d-per as the parent, and we later release the clock the
system crashes -  but there only if we run the dt with minimal
clocks using cprman, as it is hidden as soon as you increase enable
count of the plls because of an enabled clock by a different
device that also consumes the same pll.

So this bug is mostly hidden behind the complete dts that
just consumes lots of parent clocks, but it still may occur 
when we select a frequency that will select the firmware 
enabled but not claimed plla_per - no idea what stopping
that pll would trigger in the system.

Hence we need this patch for the running clocks , but we
also need it for the pll_divs, so actually my patch is
incomplete!

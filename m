Hello,

The debugfs output shows that spi2 is reparented under pll5 and the
pll5 frequency remains unchanged.

The request to get a 2GHz clock for spi is fulfilled on best-effort
basis by giving the 864MHz pll5 clock which should theoretically
result in 432MHz SPI clock.

The system locks up here before finishing the output from debugfs and
actually starting the transfer printed above.

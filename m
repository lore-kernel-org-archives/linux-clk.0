What is normal and what is inverted? Please specify which is active-high
and which is active-low.

That is a backwards incompatible change. Which I think in this case
could be tolerated, because there are no users yet of the reset
controller. Or are there any hi3519 based device trees that use the
resets out in the wild? If there are, the driver must continue to
support old device trees with two reset-cells. Which would not be
trivial because currently the core checks in reset_control_get that
rcdev->of_n_reset_cells is equal to the #reset-cells value from DT.
One possibility to get around changing the binding would be to stuff the
polarity bit into low bits of the register address cell.

Either way, I'm not very happy with blowing up the complexity of the
reset phandles at the reset consumer side.
If you do change the binding, is there any way you could change from a
register address + bit offset binding to an index based binding with the
information about reset bit positions and polarities contained in the
driver, or in the crg node, similarly to the ti-syscon-reset bindings?
That would also improve consistency with clock bindings, which already
use a number as identifier.

So there is no hardware polarity setting, which means the
ti-syscon-reset bindings could fit in this case.

To be honest I don't know. DRM has HDMI-B to differentiate dual-link
connections, but that is only used by Intel and AMD GPU drivers.
AMD driver has "/* HDMI-B is basically DL-DVI; analog works fine */",
which makes sense since actual HDMI B-type connectors only exist on
paper. None of the other drivers seem to care.

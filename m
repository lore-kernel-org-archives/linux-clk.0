Not sure what is meant by "legacy one-node-per-clock binding"

Right, I think different register layout between the processors is the
main reason for a new driver. This should be sufficient reason IMO.

These PLLs are same IP so they should use the same compatible. You can
initialize both PLLs for DA850 based on the same compatible.

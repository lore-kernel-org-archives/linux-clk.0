Hm, yes it would be an API change, but we are only loosening this
restriction. The only impact I see is that previously buggy drivers
get fixed. Hurray :)
Wait, I forgot about the currently 22 clk support implementations in
arch/* :(

There are more and more cases in which the clk disabling is the only
reason why an error path even exists. No it's not that hard, it would
just be convenient to not have to care about it.

I never thought about that, that would work aswell. Maybe I'll have a
look into this.

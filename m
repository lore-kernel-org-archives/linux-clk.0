The cpufreq framework rely on the clk framwork to setup the clk
frequency of the CPU. For this hardware when DVFS is enabled the we
don't directly control the frequency of the CPUs but the "load
level". And it is during the initialization that we associate CPU
frequency to a load level.

The clk part is there to setup this load level for the hardware but by
still using the frequency as an entry point as it was what is expected
by the kernel. So cpufreq will ask a frequency depending of its policy,
then the clk driver will setup the load level matching this frequency.

And to answer your specific question we don't rely on the clk API
returning an error to detect if DVFS is present or not. For this we
directly read the DVFS bit exposed through the syscon.

Hi Rob,

Pan Wen and I work together. There's really a same file included in the patch
https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/9/18/42 ([PATCH v2] clk: hisilicon: add CRG driver for Hi3798CV200 SoC).
But that patch has not been acked. This binding file will be merged if that
patch is accepted first. Could you give me more comments on that patch or
help me to ack it?  Thank you very much.

Regards,
Jiancheng

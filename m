Subject: [PATCH v4 0/5] ARM: sun9i: Add Allwinner A80 PRCM clock/reset support
Date: Sun, 29 Nov 2015 11:03:05 +0800

Hi everyone,

(resent with mailing lists CC-ed)

This is v4 of the Allwinner A80 PRCM support series. Since v4, the
series moved away from the mfd approach, and just lists the various
controls directly under the "clocks" and "soc" nodes.

Changes since v3:

    - Only build new clock drivers for CONFIG_MACH_SUN9I

    - Refactor sun8i-a23-apb0-clk driver to share common clock
      registering code

Changes since v2:

    - Move away from mfd approach and directly list the clock and
      reset controls as first class devices.

    - Use the new clk-simple-gates driver for the apbs clock gates.

    - Update clk code to use struct clk_request.

    - Add 1wire clk node.

    - Use GENMASK and always use shifted bitmasks in cpus clk driver.

Changes since v1:

    - Added missing clock gates based on updated documents

    - Added new cpus clock driver based on updated documents

    - Added pll3 clock placeholder

    - Added comments about 24M & 32k oscillators

The series adds support for the Power Reset and Clock Management
module on Allwinner's A80 SoC. The PRCM manages clocks and resets
for the "special" block of peripherals, or the R/RTC block in
earlier SoCs, as well as power domain and resets for various parts
of the SoC, such as the 2 processor clusters, the GPU and others.

The special peripherals include a standby processor core, a timer
block, a watchdog, pin controller, 1 wire interface, PS/2 interface,
a UART, the RSB controller, a DMA controller, a consumer IR receiver
block, 2 I2C controllers, and 2 I2S controllers. We do not have
documents for all the peripherals. Support will be added where
possible.

Patch 1 adds CLK_OF_DECLARE support for sun8i-a23-apb0-clk driver.
This driver was used with the mfd approach for the A23/A33 PRCM. As
such it is a platform device driver.

Patch 2 adds a new compatible string for the apbs gates to the
clk-simple-gates driver.

Patch 3 adds a new driver for the cpus clock.

Patch 4 adds the various supported clock and reset control device nodes
to the A80 dtsi.

Patch 5 adds some TODO comments regarding the 2 system oscillators.

Regards
ChenYu

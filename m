Right, other resolutions are for VGA.

Anyway, I did some more digging in A10 and R40 datasheets. I think that H3 TVE 
unit is something in between. R40 TVE has a setting to select "up sample". 
Possible settings are 27 MHz, 54 MHz, 108 MHz and 216 MHz. BSP driver on R40 
has this setting enabled only for PAL and NTSC and it is always 216 MHz. I 
think that H3 may have this hardwired to 216 MHz and this would be the reason 
why 216 MHz is needed.

Has anyone else any better explanation?

Best regards,
Jernej

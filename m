In this patch, yeah. It gets used in the next one. I defined it next
to the ast2400_div_table so that it is clear why we need the separate
ones.

The vlaue of the PLL can be configured in two different ways; one is
via the strapping registers and the other is configured via the
ASPEED_HPLL_PARAM.

I added this warning as the driver does not support reading the value
of hpll from the strapping.

The code should read like this:

if (div == 3)
  div = 4;
else if (div == 3)
  div = 4;

Fixed in v3.

It was used more than once for the ast2500, but only once for the
ast2400. That's changed it v3 so I broke it out again.

Done.

I think I must have been looking at the ast2400 data sheet and gotten
confused. It looks good to me. I removed the comment in v3.

Fixed. I moved the clkin calcs into the soc specific functions.

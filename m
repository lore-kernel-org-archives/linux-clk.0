Does anything besides the clk driver need the defines that are in the
header which are used in this file? If not, then it's better to put
those defines in the C file for the clk driver so we don't have to hop
between files and have merge dependencies. Also, the regmap could
possibly by grabbed from the dev->parent pointer instead of passing it
down through an mfd structure, allowing this driver to be more generic
assuming it is always a child of some mfd device that has a regmap.

Stephen's patch can help UART1 to switch to the higher clock, so we can
remove the "clk_set_parent" from the "clk-hi6220.c" safely and don't
need to do that workaround in advance.

You know, we don't enable the UART1 in this series, and we can submit
other patch to enable it after Stephen's patch is merged.

Thanks,

Bintian

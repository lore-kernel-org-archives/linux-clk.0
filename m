Hi,

Based on the discussion at [1] and private discussion I had with Alexandre
Belloni on IRC, I reworked ULP1 patches to remove device tree bindings
proposed in [1].

The implementation from this patches (mostly patch 4/4) is using
device_may_wakeup() API that current Linux code provides and the fact that
for the ULP1 the wakeup souces are known and well defined.
Basically, this rework (mostly patch 4/4) loops through well defined ULP1
wakeup sources and check if those wakeup sources were configured to wake
up the system (vid DT or sysfs) and, based on that (and in case of RTC,
based on SHDWC.MR), set the PMC fast startup mode and polarity registers.
In [1] PMC fast startup mode and polarity registers were configured by
introducing new DT bindings.

Since with these patches SHDWC registers are used in ULP1 wakeup sources
configuration the patch 4/4 changed a bit the PM initialization phase for
SAMA5D2 in order to have mapped also the SHDWC in case ULP1 needs to be
initialized. In case ULP1 configuration fails the ULP0 mode is used (same
approach as in backup mode case).

I measure the delay introduced in suspend sequence by using an oscilloscope
connected to a GPIO and calling gpio_direction_output(PIN, 0) at the beginning
of at91_pm_config_ws() and gpio_direction_output(PIN, 1) at the end of
at91_pm_config_ws(). With these I measureed on oscilloscope the difference
b/w the front changes. The measured time was *1.56ms*. Keep in mind that
gpio_direction_output() will call, in the end,
atmel_gpio_direction_output() which access 4 registers to toggle the PIN
(in at91_pm_config_ws() there are also 4 peripheral register accesses).

Besides this rework, I took the chance and I appended few other patches to
this series, based on Wenyou Yang's previous work, related to ULP modes.

Patch 1/4: replaces slow clock with ULP0
Patch 2/4: is the Wenyou's patch wich adds ULP1 support
Patch 3/4: is defining PMC fast startup registers

The patches were based on v4.18-rc1.

Having *one* DT (in U-Boot, for instance), and just passing this one via
UEFI to the kernel - without knowing *which* exact kernel this will be
(older Linux, newer Linux, some *BSD). Using this we would need to have
the current DT in there (because we would break older kernels
otherwise). Which means we can't benefit from newer DTs and clocks in
there. Which would counteract the actual purpose of this change
(improved clock support) - hence my question.
In UEFI boot land we generally don't consider per-kernel DTs, as the DT
is referenced in the UEFI system table. Yes, grub can pass on a specific
DT, but this is considered a hacking and development vehicle (for people
like you and me) and not meant for public consumption.
So booting via UEFI mandates *one* valid DT for a particular system.

Fair enough, but this should be mentioned somewhere.

Well, as far as we only talk about *additions* (or compatible changes) I
don't see much of an issue. There will always be feature updates, and
this would just boil down to update the DT to make use of them. Older
kernels would just ignore any new and fancy nodes.

Fair enough, but as mentioned above that would have been a good
rationale in some commit message or cover letter. As it stands now it
reads to me as: "Let's break stuff because sunxi-ng is much cooler" ;-)

I completely understand the reasoning from a point of view like five
years ago. But in the meantime I think we have a pretty good
understanding of how the clocks work - sunxi-ng having almost complete
support proves this. And we also know how to abstract this properly, as
this is now done inside the driver. What's just unfortunate is that
those abstraction are modelled inside the *Linux* *driver* file, and not
inside DT. I understand that it's easier to just model this with some
linked C structs, but this now has the unfortunate side effect of
requiring kernel changes for slightly different SoCs. If those details
would be described in the DT, a vendor could just provide a .dtb (for
instance in some on-board memory) and we could boot existing
distributions (or installers) without further ado.

That's an interesting argument, but I wonder if it's that hard to change
all clock references instead.

OK, but I don't see how this differs from providing a separate clock
driver (with it's own compatible) from the outright.

Also it brings the burden of duplicating the Linux driver implementation
to other DT consumers. And I feel a bit bad towards BSD people since
they can't just copy code over.

Cheers,
Andre.

Hi,


Problems:
1. Deadlocks on prepare lock in following scenario:
 - prepare_enable(some external clock through i2c)
   - i2c transfer
     - prepare_enable(i2c lock in SoC)
       - deadlock
See [1]. We implemented a workaround for this in few places like
10ff4c5239a1 ("i2c: exynos5: Fix possible ABBA deadlock by keeping I2C
clock prepared") and 34e81ad5f0b6 ("i2c: s3c2410: fix ABBA deadlock by
keeping clock prepared")

The goal would be to remove also this workaround.

2. The global prepare and enable locks are over-used. I didn't test the
congestion but intuition says that they could be improved.


Solution:
Make this locks per controller. This will directly solve problem #1
because these are different controllers. Still in-controller deadlock
could occur but we couldn't find a real case with it.


Question:
What do you think about it? I know that talk is cheap and code looks
better but before starting the work I would like to hear some
comments/opinions/ideas.


Best regards,
Krzysztof

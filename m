I did a test with HAND_OFF and that works very well indeed!

Here the corresponding patch:

Note that I am not sure if that is also needed for the pll
and pll-div - there may be some explicit consumers of the pll_div

At least that latest issue we have seen with the pcm clock has gone =
away.

That is a setup where the clock bcm2835 is only referenced in the device=20=

tree for pcm.

Using pcm-audio would trigger a machine halt before this patch.
Now this does not happen.

Hope that this is the best solution and an incentive to get those
CLK_ENABLE_HAND_OFF patches in as there is now the first user.

I will post this as a patch.

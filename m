Thanks a lot for doing this, we have historically done something similar
on ARCH_BRCMSTB platforms in our downstream tree with a concept of a
"software" clock which has multiple parents (yikes), using the bulk
accessors would essentially allow us to remove part of this hack, so I
am all in favor of this!

A quick look through. I've no problems with changing the design, but I'd
like to keep the original names, i.e. pll6x2 for the clock module bits,
and pll6 for the fixed divider. It better matches the user manual.

>From the PLL6 register description:
In the Clock Control Module, PLL(2X) output = PLL * 2= 24 MHz * N * K.

And all places that use the "normal" output say PLL_PERIPH (that is PLL6),
while MBUS on A23/A33 use the 2X output, and say PLL_PERIPH(2X).

On the side, do we want to get rid of all the divs clocks?

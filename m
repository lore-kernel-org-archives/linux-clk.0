Since this is S0ix, the "system level" is 0 all the time (as I said in a
previous message).

So there seem to be two possible ways to address this, unfortunately both
based on white- or blacklisting.

One of them would be to only do the d31fd43c0f9a4 approach for selected
systems where it needs to be done to avoid breakage.  The other one would
be to do it for all systems by default and blacklist the ones where that
leads to problems.

IMO it is better to disable clocks over suspend-resume, because that reduces
the system's power draw while suspended.  So that's what I would do and then
keep the clocks running only if that is known to be necessary.

Thanks,
Rafael

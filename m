I think the first four patches take care of building for ARM,
but the problem remains if you want to enable COMPILE_TEST as
we need for certain automated checking.

Exactly. The last time this came up, I think we agreed to implement a
helper using glob_match() on the soc_device strings. Unfortunately
this hasn't happened then, but I'd still prefer that over yet another
vendor-specific way of dealing with the generic issue.

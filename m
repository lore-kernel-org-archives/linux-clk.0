Good job detective ;)
What is strange is that amlogic seems to have change the index of these parents
on the gxbb. I have a documentation (which I'm not at liberty to share
unfortunately) which gives the following index on the S905:
0: xtal
1: fclk_div2
2: fclk_div3
3: flck_div5
4: fclk_div7
5: mpll2
6: mpll3
7: gp0

Did they change the ids, or is the documentation wrong ? I don't know, but we'll
to pay attention to that if you port your NAND work the gx family.

You can drop this table, you don't need it.

If you go for CLK_SET_RATE_NO_REPARENT, I think this flag is not really useful.

I think you are trying to tightly control all those elements in your nand
driver, aren't you ? To mimic the vendor driver settings, maybe ?

While it would surely work, another way is possible. You could give the flag
CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT (and drop the CLK_SET_RATE_NO_REPARENT) to all those
elements and let the CCF do the work for you.

There is a good chance it will come with same settings anyway (if that's the
best math can provide)

The good thing about it is that it hides those quirks from your driver. So if
the gxbb has slighly different clock setup for the nand, you won't have to deal
with it in your driver, just call clk_set_rate on the gate and be done with it.

Could you give it try ?

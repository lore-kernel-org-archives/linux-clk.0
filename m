Subject: [PATCH v2 0/6] clk: sunxi-ng: Add support for A83T's PRCM
Date: Wed, 31 May 2017 15:58:18 +0800

Hi everyone,

This is the remaining parts of my A83T PRCM support series, along with
changes requested by Maxime.

Patch 1 updates the device tree bindings for the PRCM, adding pll-periph
to the list of required clocks

Patch 2 adds a device node for the PRCM on the A83T SoC, updated from v1
to include the pll-periph clock.

Patch 3 exports the PLL_PERIPH0 clock from the CCU on the H3/H5, for
consumption by the PRCM.

Patch 4 adds the pll-periph clock to the PRCM device node on the H3/H5.

Patch 5 / 6 are the same as 3 / 4, but for the A64.


Excerpt from v1 cover letter:

This series adds support for the A83T's PRCM to the existing sun8i-r-ccu
driver. When the sun8i-r-ccu driver was introduced, indices were reserved
for all the possible clocks and resets of the sun8i family. In patch 2
we simply pick existing clocks, and implement ones that are different or
missing.

Differences from other sun8i implementations include different clock parent
names, due to the A83T not having a proper 32.768 kHz oscillator, and
different predividers for the IR clock.


Still to come are support for R_PIO and RSB on the A83T.

Regards
ChenYu

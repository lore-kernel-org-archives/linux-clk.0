I checked the wiki, it says "The Orange Pi PC board uses the
SY8106A voltage regulator for providing the CPU core voltage
(VDD_CPUX). The default CPU voltage is 1.2V after power-on
(selected by the resistors on the PCB) and can be changed at
runtime by software via I2C interface. According to the table
above, this default voltage should be safe for using with the
CPU clock frequencies up to 1008MHz. The H3 datasheet specifies
1.5V as the absolute maximum for the VDD_CPUX voltage and
1.4V as the recommended maximum." in the "Xunlong Orange Pi PC"
page.

No problem... But I think the H3 part of the patch is still not merged
yet...

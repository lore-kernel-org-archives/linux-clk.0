Subject: [PATCH 0/5] clk: sunxi-ng: Add support for A83T CCU
Date: Tue, 14 Feb 2017 11:35:21 +0800
Message-Id: <20170214033526.16977-1-wens@csie.org>

Hi everyone,

This is yet another series that adds support for the A83T CCU.
The A83T CCU has a mix of new styled (like the A80) clocks at
old (like A3x) offsets. Some differences include:

  - D1/D2 style PLL clocks
  - divisible audio module clocks
  - new timing mode for mmc2 module clock

Patch 1 fixes the mp style clock to take into account pre-dividers
for the .set_rate and .recalc_rate callbacks.

Patch 2 makes the gate clocks support common pre-dividers. This is
used to make the HSIC 12M clock have the right clock rate.

Patch 3 adds a compatible string for the A83T CCU to the sunxi-ccu
bindings.

Patch 4 adds the driver for the A83T CCU.

Patch 5 adds the CCU device nodes, and fixes up any existing clock
phandles in the dtsi.

Let me know what you think.


Regards
ChenYu

Subject: [PATCH v2 0/8] i.MX early debug UART clock fixes
Date: Fri,  4 Sep 2015 18:00:11 +0200
Message-Id: <1441382419-4343-1-git-send-email-l.stach@pengutronix.de>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

This series fixes a long standing interaction issue between the
kernels early debug facilities and the i.MX clock drivers.

Both earlyprintk and earlycon rely on the bootloader setup clocks
for the UARTs to be retained during kernel init. As those clocks are
only enabled in hardware, but not referenced in software they (or even
their parent clocks) may get disabled as a result of other clocks being
en-/disabled during boot.

This results in missing messages from the early debug console until the
regular system console takes over, or even worse system hangs in response
to unclocked register accesses. This renders those debugging facilities a
lot less useful.

The fix implemented here is to check if any of this early debugging is
enabled and keep the UART clocks referenced and enabled in that case.
The clocks will then only be disabled at the end of kernel init, at which
point the real console should have taken over and the early outputs being
disabled.

I've runtime tested this on i.MX6Q and i.MX53, other platforms are only
compile tested. This is mostly a mechanical change, but still I would
appreciate some testing.

Changes since v1:
- reworked logic to require significantly less code in the individual
  clock drivers

Regards,
Lucas

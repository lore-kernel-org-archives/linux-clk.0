Having a separate output port for channel 1 was one option we discussed.
However it wouldn't work well with the kernel's of_graph based crtc
detection (drm_of_find_possible_crtcs / drm_of_find_possible_crtcs),
which has the crtcs bound via the output port. As the logic is used
by multiple drivers, I'm not sure it's easy to rework or test.

Also, we still have to support old device trees using channel 1 from
output port 0 endpoint 1. This is the TV encoder on sun5i (A10s/A13/R8).

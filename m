I need to look at those patches again, but I do not think they address
the problem I described above: abstraction at the wrong level (or more
specifically, combining two abstract layers into one).

I'll have more bandwidth to look at this problem after the next merge
window. The clk framework is slowly be rewritten in bits and pieces here
on the list (shh don't tell anybody) and this is on my radar and
Stephen's.

Mike

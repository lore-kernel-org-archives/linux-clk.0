Subject: [PATCH 00/10] A trial to Allwinner H3 DVFS support
Date: Sun, 23 Jul 2017 18:27:39 +0800
Message-Id: <20170723102749.17323-1-icenowy@aosc.io>

This patchset is a trial for DVFS support for Allwinner H3 SoC,
considering two kinds of adjustable regulators used on H3 boards:
SY8106A I2C-controlled regulator and SY8113B regulator (controllable
by GPIO with some special designs on the board).

PATCH 1 and PATCH 2 are for the SY8106A regulator, then PATCH 3 and
PATCH 4 are for the r_i2c bus, which is used by boards with SY8106A
to communicate with the regulator.

PATCH 5 and 6 are CCU fixes for H3 DVFS.

PATCH 7 is adding new compatible strings to the cpufreq-dt driver.

PATCH 8 adds the opp-v2 table for H3 SoC (without OPPs higher than
1.008GHz).

PATCH 9 and 10 finally adds DVFS support for two boards, Orange Pi
Zero (SY8113B) and Orange Pi PC (SY8106A).

Tested on these boards mentioned.

PATCH 9 and 10 finally adds DVFS support for two boards, Orange Pi
Zero (SY8113B) and Orange Pi PC (SY8106A).

Tested on these boards mentioned.

Chen-Yu Tsai (1):
  clk: sunxi-ng: h3: gate then ungate PLL CPU clk after rate change

Icenowy Zheng (4):
  clk: sunxi-ng: allow set parent clock (PLL_CPUX) for CPUX clock on H3
  cpufreq: dt: Add support for some new Allwinner SoCs
  ARM: sun8i: h3: add operating-points-v2 table for CPU
  ARM: sun8i: h2+: add SY8113B regulator used by Orange Pi Zero board

Ondrej Jirman (5):
  dt-bindings: add binding for the SY8160A voltage regulator
  regulator: add support for SY8106A regulator
  ARM: sunxi: h3/h5: Add r_i2c pinmux node
  ARM: sunxi: h3/h5: Add r_i2c I2C controller
  ARM: dts: sun8i: Add SY8106A regulator to Orange Pi PC

I know what you mean (my first thought, too) and I totally agree, but we
need it still for PLL5, which does not carry the original name in the DT
output names.
So at least this workaround here does not work, I guess we have to come
up with something different - which would be a different patch.
I can take a look into this later.

Thanks,
Andre.

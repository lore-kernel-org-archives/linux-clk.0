Hi Arnd,

Any comments? 
Please reply when you see the email since we want this eSDHC issue to be fixed soon.

All the patches are Freescale-specific and is to fix the eSDHC driver.
Could we let them merged first if you were talking about a new way of abstracting getting SoC version.


Thanks :)


Best regards,
Yangbo Lu

The thread didn't seem to finish, so here's some review.

It's nice that we're grouping the different platforms under one
umbrella config for the iProc architecture. That way we don't
have to see it unless we're targeting the platform. We should
probably do something similar for kona too in case anyone cares
about code bloat there.

Please remove this comment block and drop the depends on
COMMON_CLK_IPROC in the configs below. The if section will keep
things properly indented and avoid duplicating that depends on
statement. Plus the comment pretty much duplicates what is
already in the help for COMMON_CLK_IPROC.

We can make COMMON_CLK_IPROC into a hidden option and introduce a
new grouping config if we really care about that case where the
base support is built but there aren't any users. I'd rather not
care though to simplify things.

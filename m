I'll refer to Maxime about this. The feature flag was there from day
one. We only started to implement support for it later on. I'm not
sure if there was a reason to add them as feature flags, instead of
a field that defaults to something (0 even).

Otherwise it's a reasonable change. And we probably don't have to
do a wholesale change for the other clocks in one go. Incidentally
I have a A83T audio series that also adds post-dividers for another
clock type. I'll wait for a conclusion on this end before posting
it.

Correct. But you can't unset the feature flag. So a copy is needed.

See above about the feature flag.

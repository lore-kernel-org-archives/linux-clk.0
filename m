Which is also pretty fragile because it doesn't lock the rate either.

I'm not sure it's something we can enforce, really. The firmware can
modify clocks behind our back. Other clocks might change this one as a
side-effect of a rate change or reparenting, etc. It's just not
something we can commit to.

So I know it's not really what you had in mind, but if you are only
concerned about the transition from the bootloader to the DRM driver,
then I think supporting the following work would help:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260423-drm-state-readout-v2-0-8549f87cb978@kern=
el.org

With that series, we can build the initial KMS state from the hardware
state, which means that if you were to change the resolution at boot, it
would be executed just like any mode change in KMS.

The initial state allocation is now fallible as well, so if you remove
simple-framebuffer after drm_mode_config_create_initial_state has been
called and has succeeded, then you know that the driver is now in
charge, picked up the configuration, and has taken all the resources
needed to continue running. And if it fails for any reason,
simple-framebuffer is still functional.

This should help mitigate your initial problem, even though it's a
widely different solution.

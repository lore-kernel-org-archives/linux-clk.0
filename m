Hi Marek,

I've sent another patch addressing the same issue (sorry, I did not see your
thread earlier)

While I agree parent adopting orphan need to take care of any existing count,
your solution could be missing a few things, like dealing with
CLK_OPS_PARENT_ENABLE clock types

Fortunately, __clk_set_parent_before() and __clk_set_parent_after() already deal
with those annoying stuff and does count migration well.

Would you mind trying this change [0] and let me know if works for you as well ?

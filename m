We still need some way of figuring out what mux value to set for those
cases. Let's keep your solution for now. We can work on it later when
we have an actual use case to deal with.

At this point, the only reference is Allwinner's kernel, and the old 3.4
kernel for A10/A20. I could try getting HDMI working on the A31 to get
some real results.

FWIW, the registers do not seem to be aliased across the two TCONs.

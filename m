I believe the only reason to keep them separate is to have kernel side 
of things modular. If we have separate nodes, the drivers can be probed 
separately.

If not, we need to build one huge blob with all the features in it, so 
the main driver can probe everything in one go, with annoying 
back-and-forth callbacks in place (assuming we still want to keep stuff 
somehow modular.)

Subject: [PATCH 0/7] usb/phy: Add Amlogic Meson8b and GXBB USB support
Date: Sun,  4 Sep 2016 23:31:45 +0200
Message-Id: <20160904213152.25837-1-martin.blumenstingl@googlemail.com>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

This series adds initial support for the DWC2 USB controllers and Meson
specific USB PHYs found in Meson8b and GXBB SoCs, which means:
- new DWC2 bindings and platform specific core configuration
- a PHY driver supporting the USB2 PHY on Meson8b and GXBB SoCs

The first DWC2 controller is usually configured in OTG mode, whereas
the second DWC2 controller is usually configured in host(-only) mode.

Unfortunately no (public) datasheet is available and the reference PHY
driver does not contain comments or speaking register name definitions.
The nice people from BayLibre have already requested the datasheets
(currently we can for example only guess that there is a mux clock
inside the PHY, but we don't know it's parents).

With this series both DWC2 controllers are configure in host mode,
because the reference driver polls some of the PHY registers in OTG
mode and then re-configures the dwc2 driver instance accordingly (if
anyone is interested, this is the relevant piece of code: [0]). This
seems good enough for the beginning though.

Actually the PMC is not only exposing clocks. You have a bit in one of
its registers that is used by a USB driver to enable a BIAS, and
probably other things that are not directly related to clocks. Hence
the idea to declare the PMC as an MFD/syscon device (which is in turn
providing an IRQ chip).

Note that the irq problem we're talking about cannot be addressed by
simply moving everything into the ->probe() function of the platform
driver: we need the clock quite early in the boot process (it's
required for the initial clocksource device), in the other hand you
can't request threaded irqs when you're so early in the boot process,
and this becomes a problem when you apply the preempt-RT patch which
moves all standard irqs to threaded ones.
So the idea was to use polling instead of the irq event until we are
able to register threaded irqs, and then switch to an irq-able approach
once everything is in place (platform devices are probed after the
thread infrastructure has been setup, which is why we used this trick).

This whole series was actually made for 2 reasons:
- expose the PMC as a syscon device so that the USB driver can access
  it's register without having to expose a global void __iomem *
  variable
- address the preemt-RT/threaded irq problem I explained above

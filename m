No problem at all, thanks for the review!

I understand now, thanks a lot for the good explanation! So my
thinking is wrong for the general case of the clock framework itself,
and that actually makes a lot of sense.

But the clk_factors_determine_rate function in
drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-factors.c works on the assumption that the
returned rate must be less or equal to the requested rate. At least
that is what the code in that function tries to do. That the mod0
factor calculation doesn't check the m and div variables for overflow
undermines the intended behaviour, as it "lies" about the frequencies
that the hardware can support. And for very low frequencies below
80kHz, clk_set_rate does currently return -EINVAL. There are even
cases when it results in a division by zero error, for example if you
request a rate of 94kHz from a 24Mhz parent (24000000 / 94000 =
255,32, rounded up to 256 = 0 on the u8 variable).

Now I'm unsure what to do here... If the clock driver should only
return an error in real error cases and not when the requested
frequency isn't reachable, then clk_factors_determine_rate needs to be
changed as well?

Yes, thanks for the reminder :-) I thought about it just as I hit the
"send" button, but it was too late then.

No, I didn't do a thorough test, only booted the board with some mod0
users (mmc, spi, ss) and watched them request their frequencies
successfully. But this is an edge case, only affecting certain "weird"
frequencies. And the only effect is that the chosen frequency is not
the optimal one. So maybe I should drop it because it looks too
disruptive for too little gain?

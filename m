Ok so that sounds like the typical case where a new SoC/board is
supported and the dts files don't do anything useful until the
driver support lands. We don't usually care about bisection
problems here because the board doesn't transition from 'working'
to 'not working'. It only transitions from 'not working' to
'working' once the clk driver and the dts files are both present
in the tree.

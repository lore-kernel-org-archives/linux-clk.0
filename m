Yes. So what? If you have a broken DT, it will not work. Just don't do
it. I don't understand why we want to defend against this case.

Sorry, but what else do we trust?

I am not sure if that is really an issue. I would expect people doing
SoC bringup to be able to cope with those kinds of problems.

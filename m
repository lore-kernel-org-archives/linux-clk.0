That's correct, however image a situation where some other driver probes
that uses the same parent clock as the earlycon UART, before the real
serial driver is up. This driver requests and enables the parent clock,
then goes into runtime suspended state, disabling the clock. As the
clock has been enabled by this driver we now have the transition from
enabled to disabled, disabling the bootloader enabled clock.

The same can happen with driver probe deferal.

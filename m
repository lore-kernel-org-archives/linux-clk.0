Great! Thank you a lot for the detailed explanation. Now I can understand
why the clk drivers follow different models, I think I get Sebastian and
Stephen's view points. Although the BG4CT clock/pll IP are shared in all
newer than BG2Q SoCs (the only difference is how many clocks, how many plls,
and their register address), I'll follow Sebastian's suggestions -- one
entire clock controller node for all clocks/plls block

Yes, it's clear now. I knew the history and the reason why there are different
models in clk drivers.

Will cook a newer BG4CT clk series for review.

Thank you,
Jisheng

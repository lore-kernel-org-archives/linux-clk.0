Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] arm64: Allwinner A64 support based on sunxi-ng
Date: Fri,  9 Sep 2016 22:10:25 +0200

Hi,

As it was in the first iteration, this is the A64 support based on the
new sunxi-ng clock framework.

The support for it is quite minimal at the moment, but it should be
fairly easy to add new devices, as most of the design is shared with
older SoCs.

Let me know what you think,
Maxime

Changes from v1:
  - Split the A64 CCU support out of the H3 driver
  - Added the PMU support
  - Removed the clocks node
  - Rebased on top of current sunxi/clk-for-4.9 branch

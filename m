hmm, I don't see a way to do that. Perhaps we could prepare/unprepare
these as part of the pm_domain attach/detach to a device and then
only enable/disable them as part of the gdsc_enable/disable?

Yes, we would probably run into these issues with probe defer for
orphan clks. One way to handle it could be to decouple the probing
of the clocks and powerdomain parts of the controller. Like the clock
driver can probe and then register a dummy device for powerdomains
(like is done for tsens on 8960) so it could probe independently?

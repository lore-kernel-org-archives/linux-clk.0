That's fine with me. I just went that way because I assumed the plan
was for subsystems to move to consume fw data through fwnode and drop
as much fw-specific code as possible.

But I have just looked at fwnode_get_named_gpiod and the OF and ACPI
code paths are so dissimilar that I guess that's not so and would be
better to do as you say.

Thanks,

Tomeu

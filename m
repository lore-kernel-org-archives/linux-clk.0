This can certainly be changed per device via device-tree.  It does run
fine with the cpu at 396MHz, that limitation was previously imposed
due to the clock parent that was being used when the VPU was clocked
to 352MHz.  There have been hints in commits that higher cpu core
voltage is needed, but I have not found any instability so don't
believe this is the case.  Obviously the more people that we can have
test this change the better.

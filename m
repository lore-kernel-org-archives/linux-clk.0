It should help as the SPI clocks and the (in this case) CODEC
clocks are unlikely to be on the same controller.

Apologies for being unclear there, I was really just referring to
where the source for each clock is coming from. Given controllers
C1 and C2, and putting the clock in brackets afterwards:

C1(MCLK@26MHz) is the parent of C2(FLL@24.576MHz) which is the parent
of C1(AUDIO@24.576MHz). Which makes C2 both a parent and child of
C1. Its probably not that likely but I could see it happening.

Certainly I think only worrying about prepare makes sense.

I think this fixes the issues I have been having at my side. I
will try to find some time in the next few days to go through and
refresh my memory.

I guess lets wait and see if the clock guys have any thoughts.

Thanks,

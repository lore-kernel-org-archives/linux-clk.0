I have sent v2 to add a flag to clk_bulk_data to address your comments.
But I just found it might not be what you want exactly, because the
current bulk clk APIs defines clk_bulk_data in a different way from what
you are asking here.

It seems that you think clk_bulk_data represents all the clocks that
bulk APIs manage, but actually it only represents one of the multiple
clocks.  Callers need to prepare an array of clk_bulk_data to represent
multiple clocks.  That said, the flag we add to clk_bulk_data only
affects one clock instead of all clocks.

I feel this is something we can improve.  clk_bulk_data can be used to
represent all clocks, something like below.  In this case, bulk clk APIs
do not need to take num_clks as a separate parameter, and callers do not
need to maintain multiple clk_bulk_data instances.  Since we do not have
any in tree users of bulk clk APIs yet, we can make this semantic change
quickly.  Thoughts?

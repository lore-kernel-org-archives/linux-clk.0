Do you have any numbers for the power savings you achieve with this?
How often do we actually manage to stop the SMMU clocks on an SoC with
a handful of masters?

In other words, is this too coarse-grained to be useful, or is it common
that all the devices upstream of the SMMU are suspended?

Thanks,

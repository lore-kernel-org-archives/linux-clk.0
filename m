Yes, I discussed such problems with Heiko about the question:
The RK3036 i2s frac(CRU_SEL7_CON) set value is invalid when I playback a 
48KHz music:
/ # io -4 0x20000060
20000060: 01003057
read register is 0x01003057, but the result of frac divider on the basis 
of default 0x0bb8ea60(numerator=3000, denominator=60000, ratio=20), so 
the out of mclk remains 594/20=29.7MHz

I tracked the logs:
[ 49.770322] clk_fd_set_rate: 91, name: i2s_frac, rate = 12288000, 
parent_rate = 594000000
[ 49.778524] clk_fd_set_rate: 107, name: i2s_frac, val = 0x01003057
[ 49.784714] clk_fd_recalc_rate: 29, name: i2s_frac, parent_rate = 594000000
[ 49.791707] clk_fd_recalc_rate: 47, name: i2s_frac, val = 0x01003057, m 
= 256, n = 12375
[ 49.799836] clk_mux_set_parent: 81, name: i2s_pre
It seem like set i2s_frac_div then set mux is i2s_pre. I think we should 
select the correct mux and open clock gate, then set the i2s_frac_div, 
and I tried to do it, setting i2s_frac_div is vaild and mclk is 
12.288MHz. Therefore, I think that select parent mux and enable gate 
should before child node set value.

Thanks. :)

The conflicting framebuffer is removed by drivers through an explicit
call to aperture_remove_all_conflicting_devices(). Just move that call
after the call to drm_mode_config_create_initial_state, there's nothing
to integrate.

It's kind of a bad faith argument. This list is 4 issues. One is getting
fixed in the next version, the other two are specific to tidss which you
don't care about.

I really don't get this argument either. Sure, it doesn't work for msm.
But the clock framework didn't have that unsafe function call either,
and yet you did the work to add it.

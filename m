Back from vacation, sorry for the delay.

There's no preferred way yet (i.e. something supported in a standard
fashion through helpers). I'd place it in your various ->reset hooks
though. The idea from atomic helpers is that ->reset should make sure that
atomic state structures (i.e. drm_crtc/connector/plane_state or your
driver-specific subclasses of them) should match with the hw state. Either
by resetting the hw or by reading out the hw state inte freshly-allocated
structures.

drm_irq has 2 parts: irq handling, which only supports 1 hw irq line, and
which is totally optional.

2nd part is the vblank support (all the drm_vblank and drm_crtc_vblank_)
functions, which are completely agnostic to how exactly your hw signals a
vblank for a given output. Those are mandatory if you want to support
vblanks (and really, you want to support vblanks). So whether you have 2
hw irq lines or 1 hw irq line with some additional status register doesn't
matter, since the hw irq -> logical drm_crtc mapping for vblank events is
done in the driver.

Yes I know we should split up the various bits in drm_irq, it's on my todo
;-)

Yeah that's what I suspected, so sun4i_backend_commit definitely needs to
be moved to atomic_flush.

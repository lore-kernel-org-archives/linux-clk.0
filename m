Subject: [PATCH v2 2/6] ARM: sun8i: a83t: Add device node for PRCM
Date: Wed, 31 May 2017 15:58:20 +0800
Message-Id: <20170531075824.657-3-wens@csie.org>
In-Reply-To: <20170531075824.657-1-wens@csie.org>
References: <20170531075824.657-1-wens@csie.org>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

The A83T's PRCM has the same set of clocks and resets as the A64.
However, a few dividers are different. And due to the lack of a low
speed 32.768 kHz oscillator, a few of the clock parents are different.

The PRCM also has controls for various power domains. These are not
supported yet, neither in software nor in the device tree binding.

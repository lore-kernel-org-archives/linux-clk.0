Hi Stephen,

This parent assignment exists since the mx7d clk driver was introduced
in commit 8f6d8094b21 ("ARM: imx: add imx7d clk tree support").

All the mx7 dts users assign the ENET clocks in their dts files.

As imx7s-warp is the only affected board and it will be only available
in 4.9, I think it is OK to apply this one into clk-next if you are
happt with it.

Thanks,

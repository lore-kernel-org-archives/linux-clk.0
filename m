Subject: [PATCH v6 0/6] ARM: sunxi: Convert sun4i/sun7i series SoCs to sunxi-ng CCU
Date: Fri, 14 Jul 2017 17:49:22 +0300
Message-Id: <cover.ba2aaaa405a7ec685034e34926b8855fd6c9ab86.1500043741.git-series.plaes@plaes.org>

Hi,

This serie brings A10 (sun4i) and A20 (sun7i) SoCs into the
sunxi-ng world. With this patchset we now support all the clocks
in sun4i/sun7i SoCs.

As mentioned in sun5i conversion, this is pretty much standard
stuff as most of the required clocks were already implemented in
the sunxi-ng framework.

In order to make cross-tree merges bisectable, device trees are
currently using plain numbers instead of defines.

Changes from v5:
 - Added reviewed-by tags for Wens (A10/A20 dts bindings)
 - Fix hdmi clock parents (Jonathan Liu)
 - Add missing TVE0/1 reset bits (Olliver Schinagl)
 - Fix divider clock's fixed postdivider logic again (Maxime Ripard)
 - Set CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT for main hdmi and gpu clocks (Jonathan Liu)

Changes from v4:
 - Add CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT to "sata" clock.
 - Add proper postdivider support for divider clock.

Changes from v3:
 - Add support for fixed post-divider support for DIV clocks.
 - Fix wrong clk_ops for SATA. Spotted by Jonathan Liu.
 - Use numeric values for clock indices to make merging somewhat easier
 - Create separate sun7i/a20 specific header.

Changes from v2:
 - Rename driver and relevant files to sun4i-a10-ccu.
 - Drop mmc output and sample clocks for sun4i-a10.
 - Rename CSI ISP clock to SCLK as it is called on other variants.
 - Add comment on why PLL6 is used as AHB parent.
 - Fix parents for out_a/out_b clocks.
 - Stop exporting PLL_PERIPH_SATA gate. Driver takes care of gate.
 - Rework SATA clock handling.
 - Fix ahb gate parents.
 - Simplefb clock fixes (add dependencies for HDMI/LVDS clocks).
 - Fixes for pll-ve and pll-video1 clocks pointed out by Jonathan Liu.
 - Adapt to latest upstream changes from sunxi-next.

Changes from v1:
 - Drop useless comments
 - Add support for A10 / sun4i.
 - Rename driver to sunxi-a10-a20.
 - Add previously unimplemented clocks.
 - Document the audio pll hardcoded post-divider
 - Add Acked-by: Rob Herring <robh at kernel.org> on patch 4

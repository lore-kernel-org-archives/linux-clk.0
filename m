It is quite easy for existing drivers to become clock providers. Please
see struct isp_xclk in:

drivers/media/platform/omap3isp/isp.h
drivers/media/platform/omap3isp/isp.c

CCF is intentionally designed as a library, meaning that you don't need
to create a new struct device to register clocks. Feel free to BYOD
(bring your own device).

Then your IP block clocks (McASP in this case) can hook into the
system-wide clock tree (e.g. where some of the parent clocks come from).

CPU drivers? Peter, you wrote the CCF clock provider driver for DRA7
ATL, so I'm not sure what you mean here.

The original patches didn't hit my inbox, only the last two replies. Can
someone fill me in on the DT side of this discussion? Why are DT
bindings needed here? Are other devices besides McASP consuming the
clocks provided by McASP?

DT can also be a good candidate for doing per-board (or per-use case)
clock configuration via the assigned-clocks, assigned-clock-rates, and
assigned-clock-parents properties.

BTW. Pls don't hold Joel's patches for this. Without that clk framework
a lot of the aspeed stuff already upstream doesn't actually work
without additional out-of-tree hacks or uboot black magic.

We can sort out the sleeping issues (and possibly move to using prepare
for the clocks that have that delay requirement) via subsequent
improvements.

Cheers,
Ben.

That's fine.

The benefit is that we still get a platform driver and we can
associate a device pointer with the clock controller eventually.
Here's a reply I sent yesterday on the same topic:

Reasons (in no particular order):

  1. We get a dev pointer to use with clk_hw_register()

  2. We can handle probe defer if some resource is not available

  3. Using device model gets us a hook into power management frameworks
     like runtime PM and system PM for things like suspend and hibernate

  4. It encourages a single DT node clk controller style binding
     instead of a single node per clk style binding

  5. We can use non-DT specific functions like devm_ioremap_resource() to map
     registers and acquire other resources, leading to more portable and
     generic code

  6. We may be able to make the device driver a module, which will
     make distros happy if we don't have to compile in all
     these clk drivers to the resulting vmlinux (this one doesn't
     apply here)

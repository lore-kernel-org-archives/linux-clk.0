As you mentioned later, in such case per-controller-lock won't help.

What do you think by "passing" here? Pass the pointer to struct?

Yeah, that is the problem we were thinking about just a sec ago. :) The
set rate (and reparent which might cause set rate) is complicating the
design.

Idea I have is (simplifying only to prepare lock... leave away the enable):
1. Hava a global lock which will protect:
a. traversing clock controller hierarchy,
b. acquiring per clock controller locks,
2. Add struct for clock controller.
3. Add lock per clock controller.

The basic locking in case of prepare for a simplified case one clock per
clock controller:

A (top controller = top clock)
\-B
  \-C

clk_prepare(C) {
  global_lock();
  for (clk_ctrl = C) {
    lock(clk_ctrl);
    clk_ctrl = get_parent_controller(C);
  }
  global_unlock();

  prepare_cnt++;
  // do the same for hierarchy

  for (clk_ctrl = C) {
    unlock(clk_ctrl)
    clock = get_parent_controller(C);
  }
}

The global lock is actually needed for the case of inverted walk during
set_rate().

Krzysztof

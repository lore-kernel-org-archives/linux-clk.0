Maybe a small fix for a skilled developer, but a giant leap for all
users ;-)
MMC performance goes from: (4.15-rc1)

SD: Timing buffered disk reads:   36 MB in  3.17 seconds =  11.35 MB/sec
eMMC: Timing buffered disk reads: 66 MB in  3.03 seconds =  21.81 MB/sec

to: (4.15-rc2 plus those two patches)

SD: Timing buffered disk reads:  68 MB in  3.01 seconds =   22.61 MB/sec
eMMC: Timing buffered disk reads: 132 MB in  3.01 seconds = 43.80 MB/sec

So yes, factor of two ...

Tested-by: Andre Przywara <andre.przywara@arm.com>

Given the impact I wonder if this is a candidate for stable as well.

But the BSP doesn't set those as well, does it? I mean to remember that
they were all zero, expect for HS200/HS400?

Thanks!
Andre.

 One can just force enable DDR modes without tuning the delays,

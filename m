Interesting.
So you propose to add something like the following in
drivers/clk/imx/clk-imx6q.cdrivers/clk/imx/clk-imx6q.c :
imx_clk_set_rate(clk[IMX6QDL_CLK_PLL2_PFD0_352M], 327000000);
imx_clk_set_parent(clk[IMX6QDL_CLK_VPU_AXI_SEL],
clk[IMX6QDL_CLK_PLL2_PFD0_352M]);

This should end up with a fastest VPU (in fact ~25% boost is good).
Is it the correct way to do it ?
Should it be done in coda instead ? And only when needed ?

Thanks,
JM

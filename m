This is confusing, and impossible to debug without getting your hands
in the driver. Triggerring the new mode is also not really something
that is rate-based. We might want to switch to it explicitly, without
any doubt. This is what we're doing for the A64 for example.

Since some rates can be obtained both in the old and new modes
likewise, you don't have that guarantee in the MMC driver and might
end up in the old mode, even though you actually want it. And you
can't.

Which is why I argued several times for a custom function calls. Every
other solutions that we evaluated so far was a hack, at best, and was
not entirely predictable and debuggable, which is not a very nice
combination.

This is unrelated, but it breaks A64. A64 doesn't have the phase
clocks at all, and need to be switched to the new mode all the time,
without any cooperation from the CCU. Your code will try to change the
phase, fail since you don't have any phase clock, and fall back to not
using the new mode. I think we need to make a distinction between MMC
controllers that can use both the old and new mode (A23, A33, H3,
A83T, etc.) and the one that always need to use it (A64 eMMC).

You should also retrieve whether you can use the new mode or not after
changing the rate and not at probe time. Each call to clk_set_rate
might change that.

That's a weak assumption, since we're not even sure what the phase
actually is. My recollection is that it doesn't, but I'm not entirely
sure, and both the datasheet and the BSP code are not really clear on
that part either.

To be honest, I have the feeling that it should be a separate
discussion.

The whole A83T support has been completely stalled because of a single
board's eMMC. This is pretty much a cross-SoC issue, at least 4 other
SoCs have that issue already, and we need to deal with this for all of
them.

Merging a clock driver without the support for the MMC new mode would
just bring us in the same situation than the A33 or H3, which I
believe quite good.

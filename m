I had a look. We've got 24 gates being registered, and half are just
gate+reset pairs, while the other half are both. Some of them have
clocks with divisors upstream of the gate, so in those cases we do
care what the rate is. For the others they are simply bringing the IP
online.

Note that we don't have drivers for all of the peripherals, so things
may change once those drivers are written.

I hadn't looked into the power domain stuff - when I brought this up
on the list recently Philip suggested that this should be contained in
a clk driver, so that's the direction we went:

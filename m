Thanks for this stack. I just worked out the same path now. I did come
up with the patch as below. That should work if my understanding is correct.

Agreed, I want to look at ways to fix that, hence requested you more data.

Sure I am not against the patch as a fix. I was just trying to better
understand the problem. I had seen the usefulness of skipping on Juno
platforms
in earlier days. Also I am now working on the new SCMI[1] specification
and just want to cover this.

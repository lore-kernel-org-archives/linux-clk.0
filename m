Although there is a hierarchy between clocks from different controllers
but still these are all clocks controllers coming from one hardware
device (like SoC). At least on Exynos, I think there is no real
inter-device dependencies. The deadlock you mentioned (and which I want
to fix) is between:
1. clock in PMIC (the one needed by s3c_rtc_probe()),
2. clock for I2C in SoC (the one needed by regmap_write()),
3. and regmap lock:

What I want to say is that the relationship between clocks even when
crossing clock controller boundaries is still self-contained. It is
simple parent-child relationship so acquiring both
clock-controller-level locks is safe.

Current dead lock looks like, simplifying your code:
A:                            B:
lock(regmap)
                              lock(prepare)
lock(prepare) - wait
                              lock(regmap) - wait


When split locks per clock controller this would be:
A:                            B:
lock(regmap)
                              lock(s2mps11)
lock(i2c/exynos)
                              lock(regmap) - wait
do the transfer
unlock(i2c/exynos)
unlock(regmap)
                              lock(regmap) - acquired
                              lock(i2c/exynos)
                              do the transfer
                              unlock(i2c/exynos)
                              unlock(regmap)
                              unlock(s2mps11)

I still have to figure out how to properly protect the entire tree
hierarchy. Maybe the global prepare_lock should be used only for that -
for traversing the hierarchy.

I think these clocks do not share the parent.

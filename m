Flags may be better used for extending per clk feature support in the futur=
e.

IMHO how about implement a of_clk_bulk_get() to handle this issue as we alr=
eady
have a of_clk_get?
e.g.

int __must_check of_clk_bulk_get(struct device_node *np, int num_clks,
                              struct clk_bulk_data *clks)
{
        for (i =3D 0; i < num_clks; i++) {
                clks[i].clk =3D of_clk_get(dev, clks[i].id);
...

}

Then it's less intrusive.

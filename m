Yes, I can do that if you like.

Do you prefer to making it flat, like all clocks are shown in the
"Common Clock Framework" menu?

Or, is it better to categorize SoC clocks with "menu" for each SoC family?

Why is it bad?

I think surrounding all the options with "if CLK_UNIPHIER" ... "endif"
is easier than adding "depends on CLK_UNIPHIER" to each of them.

For some, I can.
For some, I can't (because they must provide an input clock for the timer.)

For clk-uniphier-peri.c and clk-uniphier-mio.c, yes.
They provide clocks for peripheral devices like USB, MMC, etc., so I
can delay them.


For clk-ph1-*.c, I am afraid I can't.
They provide an input clock for the timer (ARM global timer).
I think they should be initialized very early.


Is platform_driver better than CLK_OF_DECLARE() where it is possible?

I just chose CLK_OF_DECLARE() for consistency
and it seems the majority.

clk_register() needs the name strings of parent clocks,
not pointers to parent clocks.
(It looks a bit odd to me, although it allows us to register clocks in
any order.
In stead, we have to think about orphan-walking.)
So, we need to exactly know the names of parent clocks.

Let's assume the clock system that consists of some hardware blocks.


  root_clk: root_clk {
        compatible = "foo-clk";
        reg = <0x10000000 0x1000>;
        #clock-cells = <1>;
  };

  bar_clk {
        compatible = "bar-clk";
        reg = <0x20000000 0x1000>;
        #clock-cells = <1>;
        clock-names = "input"
        clocks = <&root_clk 0>;
   };

  baz_clk {
        compatible = "baz-clk";
        reg = <0x30000000 0x1000>;
        #clock-cells = <1>;
        clock-names = "input"
        clocks = <&root_clk 1>;
   };



The "bar_clk" is a clock provider for other peripherals,
and also a consumer of "root_clk".

The "bar_clk" wants to know the name of index 0 of root_clk
because it is needed when calling clk_register().


Let's say the names of clocks provided root_clk are, "for-bar123", "for-baz456".

The "bar_clk" needs the string "for-bar123", but it does not know.
(Likewise, the "baz_clk" needs the string "for-baz456", but it does not know.)

Of course, I can hard-code "for-bar123" in the driver of "bar_clk",
but I think it is annoying to keep the name synced between the
provider and the consumer.

So, I implemented uniphier_clk_update_parent_name()
to convert the clock-names into the parent clock name.
In this case, this function takes "input" and converts it into "for-bar123".


Is there any good idea to solve this problem?

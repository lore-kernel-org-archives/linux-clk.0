Ack.

Great. Sounds like what we have on A31 and earlier SoCs.

It could be that the HDMI clock only drives the DW-HDMI sampler and other
internal logic, while the PHY takes the PLL input directly for the TMDS
clock? I'm not sure how you could verify this though. Maybe increase M
to the maximum, and see if there is any tearing or other artifacts?
Ideally we could just ask Allwinner...

You should change it to SUNXI_CCU_MUX_WITH_GATE if you want to change it.
If there are mux bits, even if there's only one valid setting, you should
still have the mux, so the kernel can actually correct any invalid settings
that may be incorrectly programmed into the hardware by the bootloader or
user. This would be a separate patch.

How we support other SoCs really depends on whether the TMDS clock bits
have a mux or not, or whether they are connected to the HDMI mod clock
in any way.

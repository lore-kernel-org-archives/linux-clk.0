I take a deeper look today about that issue and it seems that mixer index is 
really needed only here. I did only regex search and not line by line check, 
so take this with grain of salt.

Additionally, it seems that this comparison is kind of a hack for V3s. Channel 
output CSC is done through VEP (video enhancement processor, maybe?) unit. 
Those units are only on VI channels. But every SoC with DE2 I checked except 
V3s have 1 VI channel and VEP enabled on first mixer. V3s on the other hand 
have 2 VI channels and no VEP, but same addresses should work for channel 
output CSC according to the code. Of course, that is only a theory, but if you 
want, we can go with quirks structure. Or better yet, with quirk property, 
since there may be some (future?) SoC with two mixers and no VEP unit 
supported.

BTW, how should be DE3 on H6 handled in the future? Registers offsets seems to 
be same within same DE2 and DE3 units, just extended. However, some base 
addresses are different, for example, those connected to VEP. I don't think 
new driver is needed, just some quirks structure which would tell DE version.

Best regards,

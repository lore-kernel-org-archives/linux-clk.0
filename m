Is there such configuration?

Again, is there such configuration? We thought here about it and at
least it is not known to us. Of course this is not a proof that such
configuration does not exist...

Yes.

This is not a coincidence. This design is meant to fix this deadlock.
Not by coincidence. By design.

You are talking about theoretical different configurations... without
even real bug reports. I am providing an idea to fix a real deadlock and
your argument is that it might not fix other (non-reported) deadlocks.
These other deadlocks happen now as well probably...

At least all new Intel SoCs have it, besides that there is one more
user of the struct clk_fractional_divider, but I have no idea if they
have something similar to this.

This part is okay.

On Intel we recognize this as an absence of the divider.

Weird part, indeed. But seems it doubles a precision in a range
[1 .. 1 + 1/2]

This just normal operation.

I saw similar approach in few UART drivers, but they do not use CLK
framework.

So, I could consider this one is more popular / wider, than what we
have in Intel SoCs.

So, what is your intention? If you would like to use CLK framework you
might consider existing providers and users and might implement a
specific one for similar cases.

Also it's possible to convert clock providers for, e.g., UARTs to use
this kind of divider.

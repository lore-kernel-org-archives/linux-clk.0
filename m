The problem there is if we keep these clks prepared while the
domain is attached to a device I don't see how we can ever turn
off the XO clk and achieve XO shutdown in low power modes. A pm
domain is basically never detached, right? This is where we need
different power levels in PM domains if I understand correctly.

Well is it a problem right now? I think we're OK here because we
don't have a "cycle" between clk providers in the clk provider
hierarchy. Can we clk_get() during attach and then fail attach if
we can't get clks at that point? If this works, we have a backup
plan should something go wrong, but we can ignore this concern
for now until it becomes a real problem.

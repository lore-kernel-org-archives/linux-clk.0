Right, this problem isn't limited to clk-conf though. If some
clock is orphaned by its reset default, then consumers that want
to reparent them to something else will never be able to get the
clocks without some sort of clk_get_ignore_orphan() API. We can't
rely on DTS files telling us to do the reparent. This is a whole
other problem to be dealt with before we can defer clk_get()
orphans.

In this case, I wonder why we haven't specified some sort of
"ground" clock that has a rate of 0? In the example above, I
would imagine that we have our dts file specify a fixed rate
clock with frequency of 0 that's named whatever the external
supply clock is named when that pin isn't connected.

For all we know that could cause some audio pop on a speaker 
something. Let's avoid this if we can.

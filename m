It would be great if the hardware was designed in such a way to make
that possible. A lot of clock controller hardware simply isn't.

We're talking about defining a reference to a clock control, somewhere
in the middle of the clock tree, that maybe we didn't know existed until
now. This simply is not the same as enumerating physical pins or
something like that.

To be clear, all of the leaf clock (gates) were defined in DT from the
very beginning for the SoC in question. This is perfectly in-line with
Arnd's world-view. These gates are very orderly and correspond directly
to the consumer devices that take them as input.

It's the mess of clocks that make up the "middle" of the tree that cause
these problems. I don't see why we can't agree on a way to update the DT
headers in such cases.

I'm hopeful that that the arm-soc maintainers can see it my way ;-)

I'll explain the thought process behind the gxbb clk IDs in DT again:

1) we don't know about all the clocks ahead of time. New documentation
is always forthcoming, especially in regards to multimedia-focused IP

2) we do know about all of the leaf clocks that devices take as input
and expose them in DT from the very beginning, as we should

3) ideally we should not need to expose any non-leaf clocks in DT. This
would be akin to exposing private data or state machine internals in DT,
when the consumer nodes only care about a phandle to their input

4) ideally consumer devices should reference only the leaf clocks.
Ideally the framework & clk provider driver should be smart enough to Do
The Right Thing.

Items #3 and #4 are not always true, we don't life in an ideal world and
hence, sometimes we add new clock IDs to DT. This should not be grounds
for a patch not making it into the merge window IMO.

Mike

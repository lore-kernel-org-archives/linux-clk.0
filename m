Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] clk: sunxi: Fix APBS clock for Allwinner A80
Date: Fri, 12 Feb 2016 17:31:13 +0800
Message-Id: <1455269475-8180-1-git-send-email-wens@csie.org>

Hi everyone,

This is v2 of the A80 APBS clock fixes series.

When I did the A80 PRCM support, I failed to notice the A80's APBS clock
was not the same as the A23's APB0 clock. The former is a zero-based
divider, while the latter is a power-of-two divider. But the lowest 2
dividers are the same.

The hardware defaults to the lowest setting, or a /1 divider. Since the
child gates do not propagate clk_set_rate up, and no consumers here do
clk_set_rate, this actually works.

I realized my mistake while reviewing the A83T's PRCM patches. The A83T
shares the same PRCM clocks as the A80.

Maxime, since this was introduced in 4.5-rc1, please apply this series
for 4.5 so we fix it before the release.


Changes since v1:

  - Replace the CLK_OF_DECLARE version of sun8i-a23-apb0-clk with the
    A80 APBS version, instead of writing a new driver.

Regards
ChenYu

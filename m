Note as well that Boris already sent me a review of the first posting of
this patch ("[PATCH] clk: at91: add audio pll clock driver" on 31 Jul.
2015) and most of his comments are still relevant.

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/6910111/
https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg436120.html

But I would like some comments about the whole architecture of these
clocks and how I could rearrange them and maybe use some of the common
facilities of the CCF (composite with gate + fractionnal? + divider?, etc.)

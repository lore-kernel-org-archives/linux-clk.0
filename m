Subject: [PATCH v2 0/8] clk: sunxi-ng: Add support for A83T CCU
Date: Wed,  3 May 2017 11:16:50 +0800

Hi everyone,

(Resent with devicetree mailing list CC-ed.)
This is v2 of my A83T CCU series. This is for 4.13.

Changes since v1:

  - Dropped two patches that were merged

  - Added clk core flag to disable caching of clock phases

  - Added support for multiple variable pre-dividers

  - Merged "pll-periph-ahb1" pre-divider clock into "ahb1" clock
    with multiple variable pre-dividers

  - Introduced new class of phase clocks that return -ENOTSUPP
    when the clock is in new timing mode

  - Force mmc2 clock to new timing mode

  - Added back mmc2 output and sample clocks

  - Fixed bit ops for forcing audio PLL configuration

  - Added requirement for "losc" clock in device tree binding

  - Stripped leading 0 in device node name

  - Updated subject prefixes for various patches

Patch 1 adds a compatible string for the A83T CCU to the sunxi-ccu
bindings.

Patch 2 adds a CLK_GET_PHASE_NOCACHE flag to the clk core, asking it
not to cache clock phase values. This is similar to CLK_GET_RATE_NOCACHE.
Patch 5 has a compile time dependency on this patch, for the flag value.

Patch 3 adds a new class of phase clocks that check the new timing mode
bit, and returns an error if it is set, which indicates the phase delays
no longer apply. This is a clean way to signal which timing mode the mmc
clock is in, without using any custom functions or callbacks. We don't
support runtime switching of modes.

Patch 4 adds support for multiple variable pre-dividers to the sunxi-ng
mux class.

Patch 5 adds the driver for the A83T CCU.

Patch 6 adds the CCU device nodes, and fixes up any existing clock
phandles in the dtsi, without using the macros.

Patch 7 sets the clock accuracy for the main oscillator.

Patch 8 is for the next -rc2, switch the clock indices from raw numbers
to macros we introduced with the driver. This will be updated if more
peripherals are introduced in the same cycle.

Let me know what you think.

Cover letter excerpt from v1:

This is yet another series that adds support for the A83T CCU.
The A83T CCU has a mix of new styled (like the A80) clocks at
old (like A3x) offsets. Some differences include:

  - D1/D2 style PLL clocks
  - divisible audio module clocks
  - new timing mode for mmc2 module clock

You can interpret that this way I guess.

However, so far we have not had to deal with "dangling" power resources.

There also is _RDI that may refer to power resources, but I'm not aware of
anyone using it in practice ATM.

Other than that, I don't see why it would ever be necessary to declare
a power resource that is not pointed to by any of the above.

At least when the "power level" is changing from S0 to anything like S3,
the firmware gets control anyway at one point and then it is free to
manipulate whatever power resources it needs to turn off at that point.

So I would be inclined to think of that as a BIOS issue.

Thanks,
Rafael

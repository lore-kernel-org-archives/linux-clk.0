Subject: [PATCH v2] clk: imx7d: do not set parent of ethernet time/ref clocks
Date: Sun,  3 Jul 2016 10:48:13 -0700
Message-Id: <20160703174813.13970-1-stefan@agner.ch>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

All device trees currently in mainline specify the time clock parent
using the assigned-clocks/assigned-clock-parents method, there is no
need to statically assign the parent in the core clock driver.
Also all current boards provide an Ethernet reference clock for the
PHY externally, hence configuring the internal PHY reference clock.

Furthermore, and the actual driver of this patch, specify ethernet
related parents at that early point in boot leads to a warning:
bad: scheduling from the idle thread!

The reason for the warning is that setting the parent enables the ENET
PLL since we are using CLK_OPS_PARENT_ENABLE. Enabling the ENET PLL can
cause clk_pllv3_wait_lock to sleep. See also:
commit fc8726a2c021 ("clk: core: support clocks which requires parents
enable (part 2)").

Note that setting the ENET AXI root clock parent also requires ENET
PLL to be enabled. However, U-Boot typically leaves the ENET PLL on,
hence when the framework sets the parent of the first clock, it does
not need to wait for the PLL to come up. But because there is currently
no user of that clock, the PLL gets disabled after setting the parent.
Therefore, subsequent reparenting calls of any clock which somehow rely
on the ENET PLL, need to reenable the ENET PLL which leads to a sleep.
Removing those subsequent reparenting calls works around this issue.

Also remove comments. The code is really verbose enough.

Changes since v1:
- Also remove PHY REF clock

Hi All,

Fabio, thanks for testing v1.

With v2, the warnings should definitly be gone. However, that might
break some boards...

What is the IMX7D_ENET_PHY_REF_ROOT_SRC clock for anyway? It sounds
like it should provide a clock for the PHY. However, there is also
IMX7D_ENET1_REF_ROOT_CLK and IMX7D_ENET2_REF_ROOT_CLK...

Our first design used to use a clock provided by the SoC, by muxing
a pad to CCM_ENET1_REF_CLK and enabling IMX7D_ENET1_REF_ROOT_CLK
it seemd to work just fine, there was no need for
IMX7D_ENET_PHY_REF_ROOT_SRC.

Dong, can you shed some light on this?

Otherwise, in case a board does not work with that change, something
like this should do the same using device tree. You probably would
have to add this to all FEC instances since this seems to be a shared
clock.

For some reason the FSL kernel configures the VPU to run at 352Mhz in
a very odd way that requires limiting the min cpu-frequency to 792Mhz.
It also requires clocking down a bunch of devices on pll2_pfd2_396m to
352Mhz.

The simple solution to this is to instead parent the VPU to
pll2_pfd0_352m which is unused.  I have found by default it is stable
decoding but unstable encoding at 352Mhz, most likely due to the
voltage changes needed that limiting the min cpu-freq to 792Mhz
provides.  However everything seems to work quite reliably clocking
that pfd to 327Mhz, which still gives a boost of almost 24%

In my testing the performance gain in then going from 327 to 352 is
minimal.  Generally I think you hit AXI bus limitations rather than
VPU performance.

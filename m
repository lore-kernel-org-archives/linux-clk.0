Right. This is because devm_clk_get() now finds the clock via device
tree instead of a clkdev lookup entry. However, I think that the PM
notifier registered in arch/arm/mach-davinci/pm_domain.c only uses
the clkdev lookup to match the con_id and does not use device tree.
The same thing is happing in mdio, emac and lcdc.

Subject: [PATCH V3 0/5] clk: support clocks which requires parent clock on during operation

This patch series adds support in clock framework for clocks which operations
requires its parent clock is on.

Such clock type is initially met on Freescale i.MX7D platform that all clocks
operations, including enable/disable, rate change and re-parent, requires its
parent clock on. No sure if any other SoC has the similar clock type.

Current clock core can not support such type of clock well.

This patch introduce a new flag CLK_SET_PARENT_ON to handle this special case
in clock core that enable its parent clock firstly for each operation and disable
it later after operation complete.

The most special case is for set_parent() operation which requires both parent,
old one and new one, to be enabled at the same time during the operation.

The patch series is based on for-next branch of Michael's git:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/clk/linux.git

Change Log:
v2->v3:
 * rebased version, no other changes.

v1->v2:
 Mainly addressed Stephen Boyd's comments
 * remove dupliciated code with __clk_set_parent_after
 * introduce more clk_core_x APIs for core easily use
 * move clk_disable_unused code position
 * use clk_core_x API to make code more clean and easily read

Dong Aisheng (5):
  clk: remove duplicated code with __clk_set_parent_after
  clk: introduce clk_core_enable_lock and clk_core_disable_lock
    functions
  clk: move clk_disable_unused after clk_core_disable_unprepare function
  clk: core: add CLK_OPS_PARENT_ON flags to support clocks require
    parent on
  clk: core: add CLK_OPS_PARENT_ON flags to support clocks require
    parent on

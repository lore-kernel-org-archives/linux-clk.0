Ok. Is there any need to change the mode dynamically at runtime?
Or could it be decided once at clk driver probe time/boot time
and detected via set_phase() failing when we're in the new mode?
At least, it sounds like set_phase() should bail out there
because it doesn't exist, although it could be argued that
setting the phase to something it already is set to is valid and
shouldn't return an error.

I'm not saying I'm opposed to the custom function, just thinking
of alternatives if MMC maintainers don't agree with the custom
function.

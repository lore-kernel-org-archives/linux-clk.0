Shouldn't the changes in this file be merged into patch 6/9?

So I take it that this kind of changes will not happen anymore once the
DT has been merged?
And this numbering is arbitrary and not connected to some hardware
bits/register addresses at all?
And in case we find some missing bits later we will just queue them at
the end?

Cheers,
Andre.

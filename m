This did not appear to effect the behavior.

So I found that the audio codec that I am driving with clk2 could
register the clock and allowed the clock to be enabled and disabled
by playing audio.

This is when I noticed some strange behavior. The first time I attempt
to play audio the clock does not turn on blocking the audio from playing.
After I interrupt and the clock is disabled for the first time, the 
successive clock enables work as expected.

Something tells me that a fault off some kind is occurring on initial
configuration.

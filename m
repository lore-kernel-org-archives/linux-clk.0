Urgh, sorry I missed this one and then we got too close to the
merge window to keep applying things and I was traveling for a
bit. Is this a bug that's urgent and needs to be fixed to keep
these boards working in the v4.9-rc series? Does it need to go
back to stable? The change is fairly large, so we might be able
to put it into clk-fixes for -rc2, but it would need some
justification and preferably a stable/fixes tag.

Also, what about the other two patches in this series?

I see what you mean now. I checked different gcc versions, and with my =
patch I get
the warnings for 4.6 through 4.9, but not for 5.x.

In general, I tried to only address warnings I still see with newer gcc=
 version,
as they are better about false positives. Do you think it's ok to take =
the
patch as is then? Otherwise we probably have to add fake initialization=
s which
would shut up the warnings but not help with the code quality.

Multihead support hasn't been tested, despite all the patches I've
done to try and support it. I had to do some more to get HDMI and
LCD working together on the A31. And even then there are still
issues.

The current (as of Maxime's sunxi-drm/for-next branch) issues are

  - Two outputs with incompatible dot clocks will step on each
    other, instead of switching to another PLL. Maxime seems to
    have some patches to prevent this.

  - Engine and TCON pairing in a fully connected display system
    is (still) broken. You will end up tying both TCON with the
    same engine. I have patches to fix this in my a31-hdmi-v2
    branch.

You can work around both issues, the first one by adding
CLK_SET_RATE_NO_REPARENT to the TCON clocks, and forcing the
TCON parents at ccu probe time. The second one can be worked
around by removing the extra unused connections between mixer0
and TCON1, and vice versa.

This should at least allow you to test your hardware.

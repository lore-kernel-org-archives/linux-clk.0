right, I did not realize the XO shutdown would happen via a unprepare
callback and not disable.
So looking some more into this, genpd does have a GENPD_FLAG_IRQ_SAFE
used to indicate an IRQ safe domain. We don't set this today for any
of the gdscs so genpd uses mutex locking anyway.
When we do end up supporting/have a need to support IRQ safe domains
we might end up putting a check to make sure we don't associate any
clocks with those gdscs and leave it to the devices to handle it from
within the drivers.

we don't have a cycle but I was worried about gcc being deferred until
RPM clocks are probed and MMCC getting probed in between, and MMCC init
before GCC init would have us run into issues.
But I should be able to defer the clk_get()'s to during pm domain attach
and it should all work in that case.

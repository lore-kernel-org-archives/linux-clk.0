Thanks for pointing me in the right direction, Thomas!

Thanks for the reply, Darren.

I could move the arch/x86/platform/atom/pmc_atom.c into drivers/platform/x86,
but I'm not sure what the process is in this case. I took a look at your tree and noticed
some intel_pmc_* drivers, but they are quite different from pmc_atom.c in terms of
HW registers and capabilities. Should the code from pmc_atom.c be integrated in the
intel_pmc_* drivers or is it enough to move it as a standalone driver for now?

This patch comes from a set of patches that enable sound for Baytrail CR devices
(especially Asus T100TAF) [1]. The rest of the patches have been already merged in
Mark's sound tree. This is the only change remaining for enabling sound on these
platforms, so there are no additional changes to the x86 platform code.

Thanks,
Irina

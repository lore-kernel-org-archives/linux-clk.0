this is a reword of my statement above, I'll repeat it for clarity
removing double negation, when PWMx_FREQ bits in PWMCLK_CTRL register
are all zeros gate on/off works incorrectly.

While I admit the problem, the patch is incorrect, it fakes a gated
off clock by assigning zero frequency rate to it. In terms of CCF
the problem is not related to the divider and it shall not be fixed
by introducing a new divider operation, because it is an issue with
the clock on/off setting correctness.

Dealing with a complex clock it makes sense to decompose it into
a divider clock and a gate clock in terms of CCF. The PWM clock
under discussion does not fit into the common model, it has two
independent gate controls, and half of the controls is placed
into the clock divider bitfield.

CLK_DIVIDER_ALLOW_ZERO is used incorrectly here, like you stated
in the commit message divider's zero value means the same as
non-divided clock, and here it should mean a gated clock.
By the way you may notice that a divider from MS_CTRL is similar.

Theoretically it might be possible to introduce a CCF-wide flag
to describe zero value as a gated off clock, but I hesitate to
do it until I find a ground that the flag is going to be utilized
by other clock drivers.

Below I proposed two options how to resolve the problem, one is
to update clock gate ops, another one is to make zero value never
happen.

I tend to the second option, because it is simpler and direct,
I'll implement it and send a change for your testing.

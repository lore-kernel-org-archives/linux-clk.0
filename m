Subject: [PATCH v5 01/44] dt-bindings: clock: Add new bindings for TI Davinci PLL clocks
Date: Sun,  7 Jan 2018 20:17:00 -0600
Message-Id: <1515377863-20358-2-git-send-email-david@lechnology.com>
In-Reply-To: <1515377863-20358-1-git-send-email-david@lechnology.com>
References: <1515377863-20358-1-git-send-email-david@lechnology.com>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

This adds a new binding for the PLL IP blocks in the mach-davinci family
of processors. Currently, only the SYSCLKn and AUXCLK outputs are needed,
but in the future additional child nodes could be added for OBSCLK and
BPDIV.

Note: Although these PLL controllers are very similar to the TI Keystone
SoCs, we are not re-using those bindings. The Keystone bindings use a
legacy one-node-per-clock binding. Furthermore, the mach-davinici SoCs
have a slightly different PLL register layout and a number of quirks that
can't be handled by the existing bindings, so the keystone bindings could
not be used as-is anyway.

+Binding for TI DaVinci PLL Controllers
+
+The PLL provides clocks to most of the components on the SoC. In addition
+to the PLL itself, this controller also contains bypasses, gates, dividers,
+an multiplexers for various clock signals.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: shall be one of:
+	- "ti,da850-pll0" for PLL0 on DA850/OMAP-L138/AM18XX
+	- "ti,da850-pll1" for PLL1 on DA850/OMAP-L138/AM18XX
+- reg: physical base address and size of the controller's register area.
+- clocks: phandle to the PLL input clock source
+
+Optional child nodes:
+
+sysclk
+	Describes the PLLDIVn divider clocks that provide the SYSCLKn clock
+	domains. The node name must be "sysclk". Consumers of this node should
+	use "n" in "SYSCLKn" as the parameter for the clock cell.
+
+	Required properties:
+	- #clock-cells: must be 1
+
+auxclk
+	Describes the AUXCLK output of the PLL. The node name must be "auxclk".
+
+	Required properties:
+	- #clock-cells: must be 0
+
+Examples:
+
+	pll0: clock-controller@11000 {
+		compatible = "ti,da850-pll0";
+		reg = <0x11000 0x1000>;
+		clocks = <&ref_clk>;
+
+		pll0_sysclk: sysclk {
+			#clock-cells = <1>;
+		};
+
+		pll0_aux_clk: auxclk {
+			#clock-cells = <0>;
+		};
+	};

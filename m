RIght, I wrote a blurb with the more elaborate and correct story
for the device tree bindings. I get sloppy sometimes.

So the device tree bindings does say that, and the compatible strings
are "arm,syscon-icst525" or "arm,syscon-icst307" indicating that it is
indeed the ARM syscon register-mapped thing, and the ICST sits on
the back of that register.

The logical separation is indeed kept, if someone ever decides to
interface the ICST clocks in some other way, the code is reusable.

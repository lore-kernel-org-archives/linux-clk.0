It should, but would it be included twice? I suppose the linker
is smart enough to spot this?

That means we would have to determine the pre-divider value first,
in the case of dynamic ones, and they calculate the common factors.
For most of the cases we just end up using the highest pre-divider
to drop that parent rate closer to the others.

There's still the problem on how to set it though. If it were one
of the factors then we'd extend .recalc_rate to cope with that factor
not being a "common" factor. Or maybe just add an extra one. :)

I believe it's: (parent * (n * (k+1)) >> p) / (m+1)

The one I came across was: parent * n / (p+1) / (m+1)
where "p" is not a power of two divider.

Actually the only place that makes this assumption is the .recalc_rate
callback. The other callbacks are just standard adapter stuff, putting
together the factors into a register. Hence my suggestion for a
.recalc_rate callback inside of factors clock. This would allow the
implementation to do whatever it saw fit to do with the 4 factors.

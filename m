Hold on,
After looking more in to this, it seems we really do not need it.
It is already taken care by

of_clk_add_provider() and
of_clk_del_provider()

Sorry for not investigating this before. Just left out from my eyes
somehow.


Actually I can cleanup clk-s2mps11.c driver as well, but only thing is
I can validate it, as I do not have platform to test it.
It should be trivial changes.

If somebody can help me out in validation I can submit the patch for
clk-s2mps11.c driver as well.

Thanks,
Vaibhav

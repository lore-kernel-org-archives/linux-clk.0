Thanks for the fix. Applied to clk-next manually.

That patch was merged into the clk tree in June 2015, based on 4.2-rc1.

v4.2 was release on Sunday, August 30, 2015. My pull request to Linus
containing this patch was sent on Monday, August 31, 2015. Thread
archived here:

http://lkml.kernel.org/r/<20150831192125.11508.92473@quantum>

Looks like it was merged in 4.3-rc1 as well:

$ git log v4.3-rc1..clk-for-linus-4.3

Alternatively we can send f66541ba02d5 "clk: gpio: Get parent clk names
in of_gpio_clk_setup()" along with your fix.

Below is the modified version of your patch.

    clk: fix clk-gpio.c with optional clock=3D DT property
    =

    When the clock DT property is not given, of_clk_get_parent_count()
    returns -ENOENT, which then tries to allocate -2 x 4 bytes of memory,
    which of course fails, causing the whole driver to fail to create
    the clock.
    =

    This causes the SolidRun platforms to fail probing the SDHCI1 interface
    which is connected to the WiFi.
    =

    Fix this by detecting errno codes, skipping the allocation, and fixing
    of_clk_gpio_gate_delayed_register_get() to handle a NULL parent_names
    array.

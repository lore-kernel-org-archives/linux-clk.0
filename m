Subject: [PATCH-v2 0/5] clk: 88pm800: Add new clk provider driver for 88PM800 MFD
Date: Tue, 25 Aug 2015 00:26:28 +0530

88PM800 family of devices provides multiple buffered 32.768 KHz clock
output.
88PM800 : CLK32k_1, CLK32k_2 and CLK32k_3
88PM860 : CLK32k_1 and CLK32k_2

This patch-series adds new clock provider driver for enabling/disabling
buffered 32Khz clock output from 88PM800 family of device. Adds clock device to
MFD and updates the binding documentation.

The PATCH [1/4], created separately, as it would be easy between maintainers to
queue it.


Note that, I have access to only 88PM800 and 88PM860 datasheet,
so enabling support for only above two devices.

Testing:
  - Boot tested on 88PM860 based platform
  - Clock enable/disable
  - Non PM860, to make sure that it won't lead to any issues

V1 => V2:
========
Link to  V1: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/21/298

  - Added new patch to the series [1/5], fixing tabbing issue in the file
  - Removed unnecessary brackets around macro value
  - Used devm_kcalloc variants for array allocation instead of kzalloc.
  - Fixed all other trivial issues.

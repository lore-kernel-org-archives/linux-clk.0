So I'm not really sure you need a hand-over, and you kind of rejected
doing a proper one anyway.

I see two issues there:
 - simpledrm doesn't safely disable its resources on QC SoCs

 - there's no way to claim the resources from simpledrm after the main
   drm driver is active.

And you're trying to work around the first one with the second one. The
second one is generic to me, so it shouldn't be an msm (or simpledrm)
specific solution.

The first one is SoC-specific, and fixing the second won't prevent
completely the first. If you unbind simpledrm while it's active, you'll
get the same issue, and you can't rely on the msm driver being always
there to cover for you.

So we need to fix both. We should discuss the second part with Thomas
really, but for the first one, simple-framebuffer having its own
compatible will allow you to trigger any coordinated poweroff sequence.

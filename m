Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] Clk drivers for NXP LPC18xx family
Date: Mon, 27 Apr 2015 23:38:09 +0200
Message-Id: <1430170693-28303-1-git-send-email-manabian@gmail.com>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

This patch set adds support for the two main clock peripherals in the
LPC18xx/43xx MCU family.

The Clock Generation Unit (CGU) is the base source of all clocks. It has
five external inputs and contains PLLs, dividers and muxes. The outputs
from the CGU are then routed to a Clock Control Unit (CCU) and a few
peripherals directly. There are two CCUs in the MCU. The CCU is a
collection of gates and a few dividers that sits between the CGU and
most of the peripherals.

Which clocks that are available depends on the specific device and it's
peripherals. It's possible in DT to setup the routing between the CGU
and the CCUs.

Changes since v1:
 - reorganize cgu clk structs
 - macros to create cgu clk structs
 - move drivers to nxp subdir
 - rebase on v4.1-rc1

Since there were no comments on v1. I hope that these drivers can
make it to Linux 4.1.

There are no dependencies in this patch set. The DTS changes will
be sent separately to arm-soc once this patch set goes upstream.

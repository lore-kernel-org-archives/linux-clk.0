Great, that looks like a possible solution.
If we doing this way there's one more question that
should we do it for other clk APIs hold by prepare_lock which
all may sleep too in theory?
e.g. clk_{set|get}_rate/clk_{set|get}_parent. (possible more)
(clk_recalc_rate/clk_round_rate may also need be considered due to
it may be called within above function.)

And it seems many exist platforms doing that work in
CLK_OF_DECLARE init function in time_init().
e.g.
drivers/clk/imx/clk-imx6ul.c
drivers/clk/rockchip/clk-rk3188.c
drivers/clk/ti/clk-44xx.c
...

Then it may need introduce a lot changes and increase many new core APIs.
Is that a problem?

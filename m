You are right. It is not safe to make such calls when we have crashed.
The other side effect is, if we don't have the debug power domain up,
we could possibly hang the system and prevent other registered notifiers
from running, which doesn't sound good either.

May be control the behavior via kernel command line ? Something like coresight_debug={on or 1} or
even use the "nohlt" ?

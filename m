The DTS file changes should normally go through the platform maintainer
and from there to arm-soc, to minimize the risk for patch conflicts.

For binding changes, conflicts are much rarer, so we any of the tree
(arm-soc, driver subsystem, or devicetree) works equally well IMHO.
In this particular case,keeping the two together is best, so please send
it to Wei Xu with the added chagnelog and Acks.

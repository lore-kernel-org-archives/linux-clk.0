Simply not done yet.

Analog TV in general is a giant mess, and there's not really all that much
of a standardized solution. I also don't have much clue at all about what
needs to be tuned with analog TV. Probably the best would be to look at
existing drivers with TV-out support and what kind of properties they
support. Then standardize them (with relevant helper code in drm core) and
use that. Additional flags on the mode, especially using the private stuff
is kinda the deprecated non-atomic approach. If you need private data
beyond the mode and any additional properties on the crtc (for derived
state) then just subclass drm_crtc_state and put it there.

One idea tossed around is to expose them to DT somehow and then just load
a DT-blob to set them all. That would e.g. also allow to specify firmware
blob paths to e.g. load the boot splash image (if uboot or similar haven't
done that yet). I'm personally not sure how much use there is in exposing
a generic drm property cmdline option ...

What's needed for sure is some generic way to do one initial (atomic)
modeset to hammer all these settings into the driver. That would be really
useful to have, since currently that's tied to the fbdev emulation, which
means if you don't have that it will be simply lost.

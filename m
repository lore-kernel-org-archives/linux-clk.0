IMHO syscon is really a better fit. It's part of the glue layer and
most other dwmac user platforms treat it as such and use a syscon.
Plus the controls encompass delays (phase), inverters (polarity),
and even signal routing. It's not really just a group of clock controls,
like what we poorly modeled for A20/A31. I think that was really a
mistake.

As I mentioned in the cover letter, a slightly saner approach would
be to let drivers add custom syscon entries, which would then require
less custom plumbing.

I don't think it's going to happen for any of the older SoCs. The R40
only stands out because the GMAC controls are in the clock controller
address space, presumably to be like the A20.

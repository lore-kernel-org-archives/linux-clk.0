Just did a quick profiling round, and the clk_enable/disable delay loops 
take anything from 0...1500ns, most typically consuming some 400-600ns. 
So, based on this, dropping the udelay and adding cpu_relax instead 
looks like a good change. I just verified that changing the udelay to 
cpu_relax works fine also, I just need to change the bail-out period to 
be something sane.

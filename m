I think because the delay time is not big.
And pll clks are system basic clocks and less likely to be frequently
enabled/disabled.

I can't agree having special case by checking
unlikely(irqs_disabled()) is better
which is obviously more confusing IMHO.
I'd more like to hide it from users.

I see other platforms like samsung&tegra also implements pll using udelay.
But difference is that they implement it in .enable(I) clalback not prepare.

How about simply remove usleep_range to poll instead of using udelay?
Cause most PLL enable may be more faster than 50ns.

And according to kernel doc, for delay time less than 10ns,
udelay or polling is recommended.

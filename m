If the functionality is substantially different, then I don't see a
compelling, and certainly not an immediate, need to merge them. Assume
for now they are to remain as separate drivers. I suggest keeping the
existing name for now as well. Let's just complete the move with as
little user-visible changes as possible.

The placement of the header file is a bit tricky as it is being used in
drivers/clk/x86 in addition to the pmc_atom driver in
drivers/platform/x86.

The best existing location would appear to be include/platform_data/

Thomas, is that acceptable to you?

arch/x86/platform/atom/pmc_atom.c -> drivers/platform/x86
arch/x86/include/asm/pmc_atom.h -> include/platform_data/

If there are enough of these, it might make sense to create:

include/platform/x86/

but I suggest we start with minimal change.

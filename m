Subject: [PATCH 0/3] ARM: K2G: Add support for TI-SCI Clocks

Texas Instruments' Keystone generation System on Chips (SoC)
starting with 66AK2G02[1], now include a dedicated SoC System Control
entity called PMMC(Power Management Micro Controller) in line with
ARM architecture recommendations. The function of this module is
to integrate all system operations in a centralized location.
Communication with the SoC System Control entity from various
processing units like ARM/DSP occurs over Message Manager hardware
block.

This series adds the base support for clock control using generic
power domain framework over the TI System Control Interface (TI-SCI)
protocol[2][3][4].

Overall architecture is very similar to SCPI[5] as follows:
+--------------+  +-------------+   +------------+
| TI SCI GENPD |  |TISCI Clk(*) |   |TISCI reset |
+------+-------+  +----+--------+   +----+-------+
       |               |                 |
       |          +----v--------------+  |
       +----------> TISCI Protocol    <--+
                  +----+--------------+
                       |
                   +---v-----------+
                   | MAILBOX  FWK  |
                   +---+-----------+
                       |
                   +---v-----------+
                   |  TI MSGMGR    |-> TISCI hardware block
                   +---------------+

(*) This series.

Baseline: v4.8-rc1 + [3] + [4] (the dependency is due to MAINTAINERS update, API, data)
Bootlog: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/23071879/ (with the addition of couple of mach patches + dts)
Integrated series is available:
https://github.com/nmenon/linux-2.6-playground/commits/upstream/v4.9/tisci-clk-v1

This is the last of the three major blocks to provide functionality for K2G SoC.
TISCI reset series is a follow on series to enable DSP remoteproc and few other
peripherals.

NOTE: Tero is currently on vacation(till Aug 28) and the series
is being send on his behalf to provide a complete baseline series
for review. Obviously, all dependencies must be merged prior to
this series being merged, but any additional feedback will be much
appreciated.

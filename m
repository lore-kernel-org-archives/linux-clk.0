To give an example, below the UART node for juno 
(arch/arm64/boot/dts/arm/juno-base.dtsi):

         soc_uart0: uart@7ff80000 {
                 compatible = "arm,pl011", "arm,primecell";
                 reg = <0x0 0x7ff80000 0x0 0x1000>;
                 interrupts = <GIC_SPI 83 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
                 clocks = <&soc_uartclk>, <&soc_refclk100mhz>;
                 clock-names = "uartclk", "apb_pclk";
         };

The clock soc_refclk100mhz is shared with the mailbox.

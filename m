That last one was another bug that happened to trigger this
problem mistakenly. I doubt critical clks are an issue (more
below).

How many of these cases are really happening and causing problems
though?

I wonder if the problem is more that the framework doesn't know
the hardware state of on/off when it initializes? So we call the
clk_ops prepare/enable functions when we really shouldn't be
doing that at all because the clk is already prepared/enabled.
Presumably for critical clks, we shouldn't go and touch any
hardware to turn them on, because by definition they're critical
and should already be on anyway.

It seems fine to call mutex lock during of_clk_init(). At least
from what I can tell we're saved here because there's only one
task during of_clk_init() time so we're not able to be blocked by
any other task and fall into the mutex slowpath.

The problem seems to be entering the scheduler directly from
usleep_range() called from clk ops because that effectively
becomes a scheduler call. Given that of_clk_init() is mostly for
clk drivers to register clks for their timers and interrupt
controllers, we should be able to avoid making any clk_ops calls
besides recalculating rates and checking if clks are enabled or
not. All other clks should be registered and configured from
device drivers later on when the scheduler is running.

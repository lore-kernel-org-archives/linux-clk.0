It would have been nice if you could wait a little longer.  As I've just
explained in another email, I've been away last weekend from Thursday
21st through until Tuesday 26th.  I then spent Wednesday and Thursday
catching up with the resulting backlog of email, and last weekend (30th
through to the 2nd May) was a bank holiday weekend in the UK.  So
there's only been _one_ day that I could have looked at your patches,
but unfortunately the little matter of doing stuff for paying customers
got in the way.

A little more patience would have been nice.

I'll try to look at them this evening.

Thanks.

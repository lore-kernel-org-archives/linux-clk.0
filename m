Thanks for catching this Martin! Looking at the difference between the S805 and
S905 register description, it makes no sense that we used the same clock driver
for what's behind HHI_SYS_CPU_CLK_CNTL1. I agree, it should be removed from the
gxbb clock controller.

In general the DT ABI should be stable but since no one is using this ID, and
what it refers to is clearly wrong, I don't think we would disrupt anything by
removing it.

For the "hole" in the ids, Neil and I had similar problem while working other
topics. We managed to dodge it but I think it was only a matter of time ...

In the end, it is not a big deal if there is holes in the onecell_data, as long
as we take care to avoid it when we register the clocks:

/*
 * register all clks
 */
for (clkid = 0; clkid < NR_CLKS; clkid++) {

+	if (!gxbb_hw_onecell_data.hws[clkid])
+			continue;

	ret = devm_clk_hw_register(dev, gxbb_hw_onecell_data.hws[clkid]);
	if (ret)
		goto iounmap;
}

Same thing is done for the meson8b.
Also, once ID #1 is free, nothing prevents us from recycling it ...

Overall, the patch looks good to me but make sure to add the change above if you
introduce holes in the onecell_data.

Cheers

I would completely remove the reference to CPUCLK and put a small comment here,
explaining why the id is free.

There are no plans for doing that AFAICS.

Moreover, it generally would not be consistent with ACPI power
management defined by the specification.

The problem with using the clock framework on systems with ACPI is
that, in general, the clock manipulation is expected to be carried out
by ACPI power management and therefore it is "owned" by AML.
Currently, there are no defined methods for synchronizing the AML's
use of clocks for power management with what the OS may do with them
directly.

In theory, that can be worked around to some extent by representing
clocks as power resources in ASL (even though the provider information
would be missing then) and manipulating those power resources directly
from the OS.  I'm not aware of anyone doing that successfully,
however.

For simple power management it should be sufficient to let drivers
rely on the ACPI PM domain which should happen automatically in the
majority of cases anyway.

Thanks,
Rafael

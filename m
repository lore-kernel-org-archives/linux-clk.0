Hi Mike, Stephen,

Please consider to pull the following i.MX clock updates for 4.4.  And
please keep it stable, as we will merge it into i.MX DT branch as a
dependency.  Thanks.

Shawn

  clk: imx6: Add SPDIF_GCLK clock in clock tree (2015-10-12 21:55:59 +0800)

----------------------------------------------------------------
The i.MX clock updates for 4.4:
 - A couple of fixes on i.MX31 and i.MX35 clock initialization functions
   which makes mxc_timer_init() currently be called twice for DT boot.
 - Increase i.MX6UL AXI bus clock rate to 264MHz which is the optimal
   design target.
 - Add a few missing clocks, ADC clock for i.MX7D, OCOTP clock for
   Vybrid, and SPDIF_GCLK for i.MX6.
 - A series from Lucas to fix early debug UART clock setup.  This is
   currently a one-off fix for i.MX platform, and can be extended to
   become a generic solution later.

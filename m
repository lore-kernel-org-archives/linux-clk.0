Just spotted: I guess you wanted to compare against that computed value
here?
But I wonder if we can get rid of this check at all? Don't we rely on
clock-names and input-debounce anyway? So we will bail out later anyway
if the DT does not have those?
Why do we need this check then?

But still you seem to somewhat support it with your changes above - by
bailing out if there aren't two clocks.
This kind of explicitly checking for a certain number of clocks sounds
not very robust and future proof to me, hence the suggestion to get rid
of it.

Cheers,
Andre.

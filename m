If there is still time for 4.2 and you don't have any more comments on
how the driver uses the DT bindings I would rather send a follow up
patch that splits the ccu table for 4.3.

Sounds good. I'll talk to arm-soc team about it. But it isn't critical
for me to get the DTS changes in for 4.2, but I would be very grateful
for getting the drivers and headers in for 4.2 so that 4.3 is ready
and doesn't have any header dependencies for all the driver DTS stuff.

Thanks, Mike.

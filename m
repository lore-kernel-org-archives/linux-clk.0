Thanks, and the other questions I asked in my previous reply are
relevant here: can you make these into platform_drivers and compile them
as loadable modules? That would be ideal.

The precedent is to do it flat. I'm fine with a menu though. Your
choice.

I find it more readable to clearly define the dependencies for each
config option.

I'm trying to change that.

Any update on the above question? I wasn't able to find the DT binding
description anywhere.

Actually, I'd like to allow a clk_register() that takes pointers to
struct clk_core for the parent. This is useful for registering clocks
whose parents are inside the same clock provider/generator/driver.

We might still need the clock parent names for registering parents across
the clock provider/generator/driver boundary. Or maybe not ... Since we
can use the phandle to fetch a struct clk_core for a clock that has
already been registered. But these are ideas for the future.

For on-chip clock providers and consumers it is usually safe to
hard-code the names since the clock configuration of the IC/SoC is
well-defined. For making board-level connections it is less safe.

Still, many clk drivers do indeed hard-code the string names for their
parent clocks.

Well, using the clock-output-names DT property in conjunction with
of_clk_get_parent_name() solves this for you in a common way. However I
would like to get rid of clock-output-names in the future. In general
I'm working slowy to reduce the reliance on clock string names, but it
is a long-term side project.

How bad is it for you to hard-code the string names in your driver? Are
the foo, bar and baz clock providers all on the same chip?

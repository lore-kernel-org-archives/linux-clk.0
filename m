Subject: [PATCH 00/14] Add A83T clk, r_pio, mmc rsb support
Date: Sun, 31 Jan 2016 09:20:52 +0800
Message-Id: <1454203266-4450-1-git-send-email-vishnupatekar0510@gmail.com>

Hello,
This series adds further support for A83T, mainly adds clock support.
Also adds R_PIO, PRCM related clocks, mmc, rsb support.

A83T difference in short:
R_PIO is slightly different from A23 r_pio. AHB1 has different parents as
compared to a31-ahb1, APB1 has different dividers.Bus gates are similar to H3,
apb0 gates are different.mmc and rsb are compatible with earlier sunxi socs.

Patch 1: adds support for r_pio pin controller.

patch 2: adds PRCM apb0 clock gates, it controls prcm related clocks.

patch 3: adds bus gates which are similar to h3, it's not clearly known which
clocks belongs to which parent.

patch 4: adds ahb1 clock support, 0b1x is pll6 parent otherwise it's same as a31
ahb1.

patch 5: adds apb1 clock support, apb1 has different dividers compared to a10 
apb0 clock.

patch 6: this patch is form wens, a83t has 16M internal oscillator, to get 
aproximately 32k clock, it's divided by 512.

patch 7: adds basics clocks nodes to dtsi, pll6, ahb1, ahb2, apb1, apb2,
bus gates, and resets.

patch 8-9: adds mmc and it's clock nodes.

patch 10: adds A83T PRCM related clocks, clock resets.

patch 11: adds r_pio pin controller nodes to dtsi

patch 12: adds RSB nodes to dtsi

patch 13: enables mmc0 support for h8homlet board, tested by LABBE Corentin.

patch 14: This patch adds support for Sinovoip BPI-M3 A83T based board, it has 
2GB LPDDR3, u-boot support is added recently for this board.


Regards,
Vishnu

Early console can be used to debug that, but it is kind of annoying to 
recompile most of the kernel when you suddenly need to use it.

How about modifying the ti_sci_init_clocks func to print an error for 
each failed clock?

If you insist on aborting the probe though if a single clock fails, I 
can do that also.

I'm not sure. AFAIK the vendor BSP cpufreq doesn't use frequencies
low enough to require the P divider, so we could just ignore it. But
then we need to make sure it's set to 1 at probe time, while keeping
the output frequency usable, which would kind of bloat the probe
function. FYI I'm in favor of doing it this way.

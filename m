Better count the files:

$ git grep -wl clk_register | wc -l
179

$ git grep -wl reset_controller_register | wc -l
25

This is more like seven times as many, which seems about right.

I think a lot of SoCs don't expose the reset signals to software,
but it also has something to with the history: the reset subsystem
is relatively new, so even on older chips that do require them,
the code to drive the resets may be either in the bootloader or
using local hacks in the device driver rather than going through
a proper subsystem.

I don't see it as a serious problem: new chips that have reset controllers
should generally use them, but for older chips there is not as much to
gain by converting the existing code.

[1] is generally ok if you can trust the bootloader to get it right
and there is no difference to power management. In many cases the folks
that work on the kernel however have no control over the bootloader,
and the loaders that ship with devices often get this wrong.

[2] is probably the normal way to do it, and I'd recommend against [3].

Interesting. My feeling from your description is that this is something
that should be added to the reset controller subsystem. It has probably
not been a serious issue for anyone else, but it's also likely that you
are not the only one that would benefit from having support for nested
resets in the API.

I think it is. All of the 'generic' drivers for devices that are
licensed from e.g. designware or ARM will sooner or later get it,
and devices that are vendor specific are even easier to change
as needed.

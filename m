Apologies for being a bother, but since it's been a bit over a week,
should I do something with this now that it has been ACK'd? I was thinking
I would see it somewhere on the git group repo but am not seeing it there
yet. Googling says that there is a "review cycle" for some maintainers, but
I am not clear on if I need to initiate it manually or anything of the sort.

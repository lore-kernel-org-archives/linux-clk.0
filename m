It's a bit messy, but it's here:

My proposed solution is this for M factor (H3 specific solution):

https://github.com/megous/linux/commit/88be3d421e958579026135d8acec4b3983958738

and this for P factor:

https://github.com/megous/linux/commit/d7f274ed0c13fa9b4099445cb6bf9b2f8f2cfa8a

Perhaps it should be configurable if the P limitation is not universal
for all NKMP clocks. But I haven't read all the datasheets.

It was verified with the above arisc firmware to work reliably, so it
should be enough. It is simpler and the factor table should not be
necessary in this case.

regards,
  o.

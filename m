1920x1080p @ 60Hz

No, it is a bit more complicated than that. H3's HDMI PHY is proprietary and 
register meanings are not known well. Because of that, I'm using values found 
in BSP driver. Those values include pixel clock divider. BSP driver always use 
297 MHz as a base and uses dividers in PHY to prepare right pixel clock. So 
the case for 1080p is 297 MHz / 2 = 148.5 MHz.

Ok.

Because indices are per clock node, i.e. spi_clk should have clock-indices = <0>, <1>.
Of course, you could have a gap in the indices, but that is both awkard and not clearly
explained in this documentation.

The index that you declare here is actually what you pass to SCPI. But the way the device
tree is presented it declares that there are two clock blocks, one for DVFS and one for
PXLCLK. As far as SCPI is concerned there is only one block of clocks, with 3 of them
having a discrete set of values, so we are at the intersection of two concepts.

BTW, for what is worth, the PXLCLK is not really that smooth in its coverage of the range.
It might have more accepted frequency values, but the way it is implemented it tends to
favour VESA clock values and falls back to a really slow algorithm to generate all other
values. Even so, it can fail to find the correct parameters for the PLLs so it will generate
a frequency that is different from the requested one.

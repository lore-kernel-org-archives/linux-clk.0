If I understand correctly, she wants to make sure that DT has mixer0 - tcon0 
and mixer1 - tcon1 relationship and discard mixed relationship. I also believe 
that this is just temporary measure until mixed relationship is supported by 
the driver.

Maybe we could just leave this out for now and define only one endpoint in DT 
for TVE instead of two? Vast majority of users will have 0-0 and 1-1 
relationship, since there is not much point connecting HDMI with less capable 
mixer than TVE.

Best regards,
Jernej

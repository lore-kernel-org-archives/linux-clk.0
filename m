I just made quick test with maximum divider and everything seems to be ok. 
Unfortunately, I don't have time to do extensive test.

I will forward the question to Tl Lim and let's see if he can get the answer, 
since the situation for A64 is completely the same.

I will leave it as it is for now. Will you still merge the patch?

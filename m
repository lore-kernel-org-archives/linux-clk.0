[PATCH RESEND V3 0/9] clk: add imx7ulp clk support
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/3/16/310

This patch series intends to add imx7ulp clk support.

i.MX7ULP Clock functions are under joint control of the System
Clock Generation (SCG) modules, Peripheral Clock Control (PCC)
modules, and Core Mode Controller (CMC)1 blocks

The clocking scheme provides clear separation between M4 domain
and A7 domain. Except for a few clock sources shared between two
domains, such as the System Oscillator clock, the Slow IRC (SIRC),
and and the Fast IRC clock (FIRCLK), clock sources and clock
management are separated and contained within each domain.

M4 clock management consists of SCG0, PCC0, PCC1, and CMC0 modules.
A7 clock management consists of SCG1, PCC2, PCC3, and CMC1 modules.

Note: this series only adds A7 clock domain support as M4 clock
domain will be handled by M4 seperately.

Change Log:
v3->v4:
 * rebased to latest kernel
 * make scg and pcc separate nodes according to Rob's suggestion

v2->v3:
 * Patch 1 changed on: 1) split normal and gate ops 2) fix the possible racy
   Others no changes.

v1->v2:
 * add enable/disable for the type of CLK_DIVIDER_ZERO_GATE dividers
 * use clk_hw apis to register clocks
 * use of_clk_add_hw_provider
 * split the clocks register process into two parts: early part for possible
   timers clocks registered by CLK_OF_DECLARE_DRIVER and the later part for
   the left normal peripheral clocks registered by a platform driver.

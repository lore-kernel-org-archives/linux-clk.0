The (ugly) script below does the trick, though it does give results
for some symbols that are indirectly selected:

SUN5I_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_GATE but does not select it
SUN5I_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_MUX but does not select it
SUN5I_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_NKMP but does not select it
SUN6I_A31_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_GATE but does not select it
SUN6I_A31_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_MUX but does not select it
SUN8I_A23_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_GATE but does not select it
SUN8I_A23_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_MUX but does not select it
SUN8I_A33_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_GATE but does not select it
SUN8I_A33_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_MUX but does not select it
SUN8I_A83T_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_MULT but does not select it
SUN8I_H3_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_GATE but does not select it
SUN8I_H3_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_MUX but does not select it
SUN8I_V3S_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_GATE but does not select it
SUN8I_V3S_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_MUX but does not select it
SUN9I_A80_CCU uses SUNXI_CCU_MUX but does not select it

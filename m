Is probe defer going to happen? Even if unload can't happen,
probe defer is a concern unless that is also ruled out.

There aren't devm APIs for some of these basic clk type
registration functions.

If we can't proceed without this driver because it's super hosed,
then perhaps we need to panic the system on errors here. Should
be simple enough to add some error checks and goto panic("Things
are super hosed").

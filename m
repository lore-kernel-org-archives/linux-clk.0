No, this has nothing to do with linux. I'm not running linux for this
test. I'm running a small program on CPUS (Open RISC CPU) on the SoC
loaded using FEL from USB.

The main cpu is just pushing messages into msgbox in a loop, so that
CPUS can determine that the main CPU is still running ok and give
feedback to me over UART. Not even DRAM is involved. The programs are
running from SRAM.

This is the most direct test of PLL change stability that can be done on
this SoC regardless of the OS. Not even CPU voltage switching is
involved. I just set the maximum voltage and fiddle with CPU_PLL
frequencies randomly, while waiting for the main CPU to lock up.

It does lock up quickly with mainline ccu_nkmp_find_best algorithm for
finding factors.

Even with linux kernel, it breaks. It's just more difficult to hit the
right conditions. I got oops only right after boot when running cpuburn
to trigger thermal_zone issued OPP change, if I first run some cpupower
commands. That's why I wrote this program to stress test various CPU_PLL
change/factor selection algorithms independently of everything else, to
get more predictable and quicker testing results.

Unless it was stress tested like this with randomy changed settings, I
doubt you can call it reliable. It may just be very hard to hit the
issue on linux with particular OPP/thermal zone configuration. That's
because the issue is dependent on before and after NKMP values. People
may have just been lucky so far.

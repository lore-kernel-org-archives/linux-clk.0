I agree; it's not going to make it any easier to read so lets leave it as is.

The ast2500 says d1clk, and the ast2400 says d2clk. Both call it the
GFX CRT clock. Normally changes between the two are in a different
colour, but we don't have that here :(

I'll ask Ryan if he knows what's going on.

Yeah. This is another difference between the SoCs that isn't called
out by the "this has changed" colouring of the datasheet.

I'd suggest it's not worth adding the code to make the driver return
an error when requesting this one. If anyone feels strongly about it
we could skip the registration of this one at probe time on the
ast2400.

The driver doesn't change the value, so I think we're safe.

Will make the table a bit awkward, but it's a good suggestion. I'll
give it a go for v3.

Nice catch. It's a typo in the Gemini driver as well ;)

Okay, I put it at the bottom.

Thanks, fixed.

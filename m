Sorry, I still don't agree with this patch. There's no reason we
should be turning on clocks during late init so that we can turn
off clocks. If there's some sort of problem in doing that we
should figure it out and make it so that during late init we turn
off clocks from the leaves of the tree to the root.

I agree that there's a problem here where we don't properly
handle keeping children clocks on if a driver comes in and turns
off a clock in the middle of the tree before late init. That's a
real bug, and we should fix it. Mike Turquette has been doing
some work to have a way to indicate that certain clocks should be
kept on until client drivers grab them. I think it will also make
sure to up refcounts on parent clocks in the middle of the tree
when it figures out that a child clock is enabled. Would that be
all that we need to do to fix this problem?

Also, the subject of this patch and patch 5 are the same. Why?

Argh... I forgot to update the commit log... :(

The old discussion is here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/5/5/77

It is possible to piggy back on existing API, but as Maxime mentioned
back in the discussion, it is confusing.

IIRC Mike said (via Maxime) an SoC specific call was the easy way
to handle this. I don't think there's anything generic about this.
Even if you could have a _set_mode callback for the clks, the modes
would be SoC specific anyway.

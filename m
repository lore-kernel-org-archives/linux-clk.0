Subject: [PATCH v3 0/7] clk: rockchip: add support for the clock-tree of the rk3368
Date: Sun,  5 Jul 2015 11:00:13 +0200
Message-Id: <1436086820-3757-1-git-send-email-heiko@sntech.de>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

This is the respin of the no-yet-applied parts of the rk3368 clock support.

It definitly needs the clock-changes that went into the mainline kernel
during the merge window (constifying stuff etc) and I'd need the
dt-binding header in a stable branch to be included into armsoc too.


changes since v2:
- drop patches already applied
- address comments from Stephen Boyd:
  - no dump recalc_rate callback
  - missing header includes
  - style issues (parentheses and saving some lines)
- fix similar issues in the already included code
changes since v1:
- add CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT to sclk_mac to provide sane rates
  when using a rmii phy with soc-side clock generation.
  Both as fix for the 3288 and in the newly added rk3368.

  clk: rockchip: fix issues in the mmc-phase clock
  clk: rockchip: define the inverters of rk3066/rk3188 and rk3288
  dt-bindings: add documentation of rk3668 clock controller
  clk: rockchip: add dt-binding header for rk3368
  clk: rockchip: add missing include guards
  clk: rockchip: add rk3368 clock controller

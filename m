It seems that set_rate() and enable/disable are conflated here.

when the divider value is zero, and it's on when the divider
value is non-zero.

I'd suggest you make it so this clk supports enable/disable and
set_rate with the same register. Something like, set rate when
the clk is disabled will cache the rate request and only when the
clk is enabled will the driver actually program the hardware to
have the requested divider value. Similarly, when the clk is
disabled we'll write a 0 there, but when the clk is enabled we'll
restore whatever rate (divider) was chosen last.

It does mean that recalc rate will be sort of odd, because when
the clk is off it will return 0, and when the clk is on it will
return the right rate. So to make things work, we'll need to
return the cached rate in recalc rate when the clk is off and
read the hardware when the clk is on. Probably an if register ==
0 then lookup in cache, otherwise do normal division.

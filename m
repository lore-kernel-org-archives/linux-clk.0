Looking at the nkmp clock code, only .recalc_rate will work properly though.
Maybe I could fix up the code so it handles zero width factors.

There's no NP clock type yet. And a problem with a variable prediv is that
it doesn't participate in factor calculation. It's effectively fixed.

I did this for the A80 as well though. Fixing up the NKMP clock might be
easier.

The variable pre-divider is shared for both pll-periph mux inputs.
This is one way to handle it. The other would be to extend ccu_mux
to handle multiple variable pre-dividers. I don't really want to do
that if this is the only instance that needs it though.

Correct. With the A83T there has never been a merged clock driver though.
I realize this is a one off thing.

If the custom function route is acceptable, I'll come up with something.

I do not understand why it's confusing.  The code already obviously
indicates this is a special handling for cases where irq is still not
enabled, rather than for irq context.

The patch is to fix the "bad: scheduling from the idle thread!" warning
rather than minimize the delay.  Do you have an opinion on how to fix
the warning?

500 is for the worst case of sleep, and 50 is good enough for delay.

Just one more thought. If we had one platform driver for the
entire PMC could we also have an OF_CLK_DECLARE for it as well?
Then that OF_CLK_DECLARE could run early, register whatever
clocks are essential for the clocksource to work, and defer the
rest of the clock registration to when the device driver probes?
We'd still need some sort of global list of clocks that we
registered early, and this list might need to be per PMC if
there's more than one PMC, but we'd have all the clk_hw pointers
available when the platform driver probed. Oh and we'd need
clk_get() to return PROBE_DEFER too so that consumer drivers
could be deferred until the PMC driver probes.

I suppose this would be making more global variables, which isn't
preferred, so let's worry about this clk_hw vs clk pointer
problem later. We'll have to keep this driver in mind when we're
converting over clk providers to registering clk_hw pointers with
the of clk provider layer.

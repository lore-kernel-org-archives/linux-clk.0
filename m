I met the same problem with LPC32xx clocks, one hardware block
contains clock controller, power controller, wakeup
controllers and partially pinmux and dma configuration.

I've sent a mmio version for review some time ago, but I had
to change interface to regmap recently.

Eventually I implement the same layout, but replace "syscon" and
"simple-mfd" with "simple-bus" only.

For a single interface syscon_node_to_regmap() I don't see a point to
add a dependency on MFD and syscon.

It might be a good idea.

I had to copy low-level parts from clk-gate, clk-divider and clk-mux to
my driver and reimplement them on regmap API, of course I won't call
this as a good solution, but if regmap is unavoidable, that's what remains.

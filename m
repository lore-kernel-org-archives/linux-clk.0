Ok, with per-process pagetables which gpu handles by itself, is the gpu driver
not going to keep its own clocks pm_runtime active before handing it over
to the firmware ? which would in this case take care of having the iommu clocks
also enabled because of the device links in the behind.

The idea here was to keep the iommu clocks only represented inside the IOMMU DT
and handled by that driver. This works fine with the video decoder which is
already fully pm_runtime enabled and works fine with basic gpu testing. Do you
see any issues in testing this with the per-process pagetables ?

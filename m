Subject: [PATCH v4 5/5] ARM: dts: sun9i: Add TODO comments for the main and low power clocks
Date: Sun, 29 Nov 2015 11:03:10 +0800
Message-Id: <1448766190-11345-6-git-send-email-wens@csie.org>
In-Reply-To: <1448766190-11345-1-git-send-email-wens@csie.org>
References: <1448766190-11345-1-git-send-email-wens@csie.org>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

The main (24MHz) clock on the A80 is configurable via the PRCM address
space. The low power/speed (32kHz) clock is from an external chip, the
AC100.

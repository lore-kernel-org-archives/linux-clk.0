Hmm... what about things like suspend/resume? Presumably we would
want the clk device that's touching the pmc register space to be
suspended before we suspend pmc itself? Not having a parent would
mean it's a virtual device which doesn't seem correct. It's a
logical device that is related to the pmc device.

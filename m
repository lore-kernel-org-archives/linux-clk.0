I tried.
It does not work unfortunately. Still crashes but somewhere else:

I have not looked at ALL the clock providers, but I have seen a few and I don't
remember seeing any which fails, at some point, to register a clocks and still
register successfully. 

It seems strange to continue with a broken controller.

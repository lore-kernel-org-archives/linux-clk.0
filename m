That already sounds like there is room for configuration and hooking
into a wider clock tree - we've got three different source options and
an output plus a PLL that can presumably take in non-audio rates.

You happen to be looking at a particularly simple system but things do
scale up and there's not a clear cutoff point which would allow us to
make a clear distinction between things that might get used in a simple
system and things that might need something more complex.  This seems
particularly important when we're adding things to simple-card, we want
it to be usable with as many different devices as possible.

Stephen fixed the bug, and I didn't ask you to test because you made it
clear that you did not have the time (understandable). Stephen
reproduced the issue locally and insured that his version of the fix
does actually fix it.

He is an equal co-maintainer so of course I support him to merge the
fix, plus I find his version more readable.

No thematics please. When you wrongly accused me of merging code outside
of the merge window[0] did I ask for an apology?

An oversight for which we are both equally guilty. The "change" was the
resolution of a merge conflict, and I posted the resolved version of the
patch to the thread[0]. You said, "Looks fine, thanks."

In summary: bugs happen. Let's please just move on and get back to work.

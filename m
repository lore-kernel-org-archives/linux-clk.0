Your patch should make the requirement for this check moot, so it can
probably be removed.

Steady on.  I said we "_could_", that that I think it's a good idea.

I think it's a bad idea, which is why I wrote this set. ;)

This set will not trigger your new checks.  The clocks will be in
perfect ballance becuase a reference will be taken at start-up.

Again:

start-up:
  clk_prepare_enable()

knowlegable_driver_probe:
  clk_get()

knowlegable_driver_gate_clk:
  clk_disable_critical()

knowlegable_driver_ungate_clk:
  clk_enable_critical()

knowlegable_driver_remove:
  clk_put()

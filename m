I am allowed to change clk name? Can do that when I re-spin this series.

I used a value that I have in a downstream kernel based on the L4T.
This frequency is well tested and has worked for me, and wanted to
avoid setting it to maximum rate. My guess is that they used 86.5 MHz
because 92 MHz is max rate on Tegra2 and they put it slightly below
that.

What is otherwise recommended when initializing clocks? The rate could
depend on the chip that is attached but otherwise I would like to set
it close to max (or max) rate for performance.

Best Regards,
Mirza

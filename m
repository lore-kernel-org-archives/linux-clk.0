Thank you very much for replying so soon.

Please allow me to decribe the reason why this patch exists first.
All bits in the reset controller were designed to be active-high.
But in a recent chip only one bit was implemented to be active-low :(

OK. I'll use active-high and active-low instead.

I understand the backwards compatiblity is very important. As it can be basically
confirmed that the possibility of using hi3519 based device trees is very low,
to keep the code simple, I chose to give up the backwards compatiblity.
Maybe it is not very convincing. If you think it's better to keep backwards
compatiblity here, I can only change reset-cells to 3 for chipsets except Hi3519.

It's also a solution. But I feel it's not very clear for reset consumer to
composite these information together as a index number. Maybe I'm wrong.

By complexity, do you mean that the consumer side doesn't need to know the
detailed information of the implementation of the reset controller eventhough
only in the device tree?

I agree with that this solution is more modular. But the device node of the
reset controller will get more complicated. Actually, the device tree of
SoC part is provided by SoC vendor. In my opinion, we need balance between reset
provider and consumer :). And I supposed rcdev->of_xlate was designed to treat this
case. Am I right?

It seems that ti-syscon-reset doesn't support polarity now. Certainly it can be extended
through flags.

Thank you again.

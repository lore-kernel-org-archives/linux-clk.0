I can see how this would be better in general, but I don't think it would
be an improvement in this case. We have other platform-specific flags that
don't correspond to common framework flags (only the one you pointed out
does). So, we  would have to introduce a second flags variable for the
common framework flags (unless I am missing something, like a reserved
range of bits for platform-specific flags that would allow platform-specific
flags and common framework flags to coexist in a single 32 or 64-bit field).
Then we would have to add comments saying that CLK_IS_CRITICAL is the only
flag that you can use for this field because we really don't want someone
to try to use any other common framework flags. This seems like quite a bit
of effort just to try to avoid one redundant flag.

Subject: [PATCH 0/4] clk: sunxi-ng: Fix issues with fractional mode
Date: Sun, 30 Jul 2017 18:41:46 +0200

During development of H3 HDMI driver, I found some issues with
setting video clock rate. It turned out that clock driver decided
to use fractional mode and selected right frequency, but it didn't
enable it. Additionally, fractional helpers don't wait on lock.

Patch 1 adds a call to N-M clock driver which enables fractional mode.
It also clears M factor before that as required by most SoCs.

Patch 2 adds a call to N clock driver which enables fractional mode.

Patch 3 makes fractional helpers less chatty.

Patch 4 adds a wait for lock to fractional helpers.

That's what I said - all VE platforms known to me will work, because
they all have the clocks wired up the same way. And I still don't like
code in a "generic SP810 driver" assuming this. Call me what you
want ;-)

Sure, no argument here.

Right, that's probably my fault. The sp810 nodes appeared in the VE
trees very early (in terms of the "DT era"), when we weren't so strict
about documentation. So far, it would be fairly simple, something like
the text below - feel free to take it, mend it, extend it with your
changes and include in the series:

Thanks!

SP810 System Controller
-----------------------

Required properties:

- compatible:	standard compatible string for a Primecell peripheral,
		see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/primecell.txt
		for more details
		should be: "arm,sp810", "arm,primecell"

- reg:		standard registers property, physical address and size
		of the control registers

- clock-names:	from the common clock bindings, for more details see
		Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt;
		should be: "refclk", "timclk", "apb_pclk"

- clocks:	from the common clock bindings, phandle and clock
		specifier pairs for the entries of clock-names property

- #clock-cells:	from the common clock bindings;
		should be: <1>

- clock-output-names:	from the common clock bindings;
		should be: "timerclken0", "timerclken1", "timerclken2", "timerclken3"

Example:
	sysctl@020000 {
		compatible = "arm,sp810", "arm,primecell";
		reg = <0x020000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&v2m_refclk32khz>, <&v2m_refclk1mhz>,	<&smbclk>;
		clock-names = "refclk", "timclk", "apb_pclk";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clock-output-names = "timerclken0", "timerclken1", "timerclken2", "timerclken3";
	};

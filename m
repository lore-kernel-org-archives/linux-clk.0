Sean, is this an ack for this patch series? I think the consensus is to
not modify DT to add a subnode for the "clk" part of the hardware, but
instead either register the clks from the device driver that has the clk
hardware inside of it, or do what this patch series does and register a
device in software from the "parent" device driver so that logically clk
things are contained in drivers/clk/

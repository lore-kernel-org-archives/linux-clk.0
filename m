You don't need to make these explicit here. Just specify that the header
containing these constants is located at
nclude/dt-bindings/clock/lpc18xx-ccu.h

(DT people please correct me if this is bad etiquette)

How many varieties of LPC part are there? Should these varieties each
have their own .dtsi that make it clear which branch clocks are
available on that part?

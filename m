I am not sure where this term MIO comes from (may be an NVIDIA term),
but from looking at the MIO_CONFIG register, it looks like a basic
16/32-bit interface with configurable read/write strobe timing. Does not
support bursting or address/data multiplexing that the SNOR interface
does. So may be it is used for interfacing to external devices such as
FIFOs, UARTs, I2C expanders, etc.

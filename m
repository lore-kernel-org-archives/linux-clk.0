Correct, we will not change existing compatibles.  Adding new ones for
clarity is fine though.

In hindsight, I think using the "meson" prefix was a mistake.  It's
redunant, IMO, but it's how we've been doing things for all the drivers,
except for drivers/clk, which, honestly, I hadn't even noticed until
now.

As Jerome said, I think consistency is an important goal, so leaving off
the "meson-" for drivers/clk is fine with me.

Also for consistency, for the rest of the drivers, keeping "meson-" is
probably the right thing to do.

However, patches would be welcome to add compatibles without the "meson"
for the rest of the drivers & documentation as well, but please do not
remove any compatibles.

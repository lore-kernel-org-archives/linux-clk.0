Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: clock: ti-sci: Fix incorrect usage of headers
Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2017 17:36:15 -0500
Message-ID: <20170711223615.29398-1-s-anna@ti.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

The clock consumer usage description was erroneously referring to
couple of dt-binding headers that are no longer valid. The definition
and/or usage of these headers is incorrect and the only file present
at the moment, dt-bindings/soc/k2g.h is also being cleaned up. The
examples in this binding were updated properly, but the update to
description was missed out. So, fix this.

Fixes: 8f306cfe4383 ("Documentation: dt: Add TI SCI clock driver")

Hi Stephen,

Looks like this was missed during the update/repost of the ti-sci-clk
driver/binding. FYI, Santosh is going to pickup the header file cleanup
patch https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9741279/ for the next merge
window.

regards
Suman

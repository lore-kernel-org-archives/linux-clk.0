You are right, the clocks of some subsystems have only a gate, but
these are exceptions.

Look at an ordinary clock, say the mmc0 of the H3.
There is a "bus" gate (see below) in the CCU register 0x60, bit 8, and
the "clock" gate in the CCU register 0x88, bit 31.

The 'simple-gates' says that the "bus gate" is child of ahb1 (in all
sunxi versions, the one prior to 'simple-gate', in the 'simple-gate',
in 'sunxi-ng', and now in Andr=E9's patch).

But, where do you see a hardware relation between the mmc0 clock and
the ahb1 clock?

Maybe I used the wrong words.

The "clock" register is the one which defines the parameters of the
clock (parents, mul/div factors, gate). For the H3 mmc0, it is the
CCU register 0x60.

The "bus" register is one of the so-called "Bus Clock Gating Register"s.
For the H3 mmc0, it is the CCU register 0x88.=09

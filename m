Hi Jernej,

What kind of resolution were you testing to actually hit this?

AFAIK the fractional mode is either 297 or 270 MHz. Even Full HD
1080p60 dot clocks aren't that high. And the clk drivers should
try to request a matching parent clk rate. So the PLL wouldn't
go that high. Are you testing 4k @ 30fps?

As it stands, I don't think any of the existing display support
can go that high, so I think we're safe as far as old kernels
go, i.e. we don't need to Cc stable for these.

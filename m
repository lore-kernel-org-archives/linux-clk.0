Personally, I'd like a little better description that talks about the
rates, not just the differences between VOP0 and VOP1. Presumably the
clock rates needed by VOP0 are not achievable just by these dividers, so
we need to adjust the PLL?

FWIW, I haven't actually found this patch necessary in my own testing (I
have eDP running fine without this change), but perhaps with better
justification, this will make more sense.

For clarification: this patch isn't sufficient for that, right? Of
course eDP support hasn't fully landed upstream yet, but I presume you
have other changes to set the correct VOP frequencies?

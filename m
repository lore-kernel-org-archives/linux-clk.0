I just made last check now and this patch is indeed OK. Before merging, please 
read explanation below.

Background:
According to H3 datasheet and BSP driver, HDMI clock has M factor (divider) to 
correctly set pixel clock to desired value. However, Jens Kuske discovered 
that this factor doesn't play any role whatsoever and instead, division factor 
set in PHY registers is the important one. I confirmed that on BSP kernel by 
tying M factor to 0. Both, HDMI video and audio, still worked correctly.

So that flag is necessary to set pll-video to pixel clock * div factor. I can 
also change HDMI clock type to SUNXI_CCU_GATE (without M factor) and document 
discrepancy with datasheet in ccu-sun8i-h3.c. Alternatively to this patch, 
just in case, to be on the safe side, I can add pll-video clock phandle to the 
dt node. However, as far as I know, that might prevent selecting another 
parent on SoCs where HDMI clock has multiple parents.

Regards,
Jernej

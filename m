IRQ chip and clocksource are also initialised before kernel_init()
which may call clk APIs like clk_prepare_enable().
We may not be able to guarantee those clocks are unsleepable.

e.g.
For IRQ chip, the arm,gic documents the optional clocks property in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/arm,gic.txt.
Although there seems no user currently, not sure there might be
a exception in the future.

For clocksource driver, it's quite common to call clk APIs to
enable and get clock rate which may also cause sleep.
e.g. ARM twd clock in arch/arm/kernel/smp_twd.c.

If we have to avoid the possible sleep caused by these clocks,
we may need to manually check it and change the related clocks
(e.g PLLs) from sleepable to busy loops.
But that is not a good solution and may also not stable when
clock varies.

It looks like not easy to find a generic solution for them.
What's your suggestion?

And Stephen,

Besides above possible sleep, the clk framework itself may also
cause unexpected sleep before kernel_init().
1) clk framework now supports CLK_IS_CRITICAL flag which allows to
enable the clock during register in __clk_core_init(), it usually
can happen in time_init()->of_clk_init();

2) clk framework also support set default configuration like set_parent
and set_rate during register clk providers which also happens in
time_init()->of_clk_init().

Any ideas?
Do you think if we should move them onto a bit later stage after
kernel_init()?

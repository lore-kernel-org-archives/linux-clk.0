Well, From below graph, you can see that 'clk_usbphyX_480m' is generated 
from usb2phy, and 'clk_usbphy_480m' which select from 
clk_usbphyX_480m_src via a gate (G13[12])  provided 480M clock to other 
modules.

   xin24m
       |__ clk_usb2phy0_ref
       |                 |__ clk_usbphy0_480m
       |                                   |__clk_usbphy0_480m_src
       | |__clk_usbphy_480m
       |         |__ ... ...
       |__ clk_usb2phy1_ref
                          |__ clk_usbphy1_480m
                                          |__clk_usbphy1_480m_src

Yeah, they used to be. However, the story went something like this,

Some PM suspend process related ehci/ohci controller are base on 480m 
clocks, unfortunately, usb2-phy suspended earlier than ehci/ohci 
(usb2-phy will be auto suspended if no devices plug-in), and the 
clk-480m provided by it was disabled if no module used. As a result, the 
PM suspend process was blocked when it run into ehci/ohci module.

Hence, we are planing to refer clk_usbphyX_480m_src into each ehci/ohci 
driver. Maybe you will challenge why not refer clk_usbphy_480m directly? 
because there are two ehci/ohci connected in the different usb2phy, and 
only one clk_usbphy_480m clock was selected in clock tree.

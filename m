Do you have examples of applications manipulating milliHz ?

Anyway, moving from Hz to milliHz is a lot more invasive than moving
from an unsigned long to an u64 field.
How about first storing the frequency on an u64 value (this can be part
of my patch adapting the ->determine_rate() prototype [1]), and then
plan for a big rework accounting for this unit change ?

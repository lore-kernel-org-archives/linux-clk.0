May I ask you what is your main concern about using
CLK_IS_CRITICAL as a stop-gap/in general?

This is just a stop-gap until we get CLK_ENABLE_HAND_OFF merged
and I really want to use HAND_OFF as soon as possible, that is why
I have split it into 2 patches.

We essentially just replace the CLK_IS_CRITICAL with
CLK_ENABLE_HAND_OFF (plus comments and debug messages).

Any custom temporary code for specific clocks (which you propose)
is much more complicated than this simple patch and does not handle
things better in any way.

Also the current situation of the machine crashing when releasing the
PCM clock when the parent is PLLC or PLLD is worse than having some
clocks/pll running unnecessarily.

Also this is an incentive to merge HAND_OFF - there is now an
immediate user that would make immediate use of it.

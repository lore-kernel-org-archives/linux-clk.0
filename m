Great, thanks.

What if the clock (or a parent thereof) is shared with another device?

Surely you don't want that other driver to change the rate (changing the
rate of the UART behind Xen's back)?

I appreciate that clk_ignore_unused might work on platforms today, but
that relies on the behaviour of drivers, which might change. It may also
not work on other platforms in future, in cases like the above.

I'm not sure that's true. A user of the clock may know nothing about
other users. As far as I can see, nothing prevents it from changing the
clock rate.

While drivers in the same kernel can co-ordinate to avoid problems such
as that, we can't do that if we know nothing about the user hidden by
Xen.

platforms/devices this is necessary for, so it's still not clear to me
if we need to care about regulators, GPIOs, resets, and so on.

Do we know which platforms in particular we need this for?

As above, I don't believe that alone is sufficient in general, though it
may happen to be for a particular platform. Without information
regarding the affected platform(s), it's rather difficult to tell.

Thanks,
Mark.

I was thinking about this as well, but am concerned about the =
dt-changes.

Also initialization order may be an issue, so I have avoided that.

There are clocks for most of them - See my patch I sent some time ago.

Right now I have got a working version with the following patches:
817176d clk: bcm2835: add missing clocks
8f74701 clk: bcm2835: enable management of PCM clock
62a7d94 clk: bcm2835: move to a different initialization scheme.

There is one more thing that I would like to do before submitting those
as a patch-set: enable the fractual divider, because right now
we calculate the fractual divider value correctly, but we do not set
the flag to enable it, so we are actually running too fast most
of the times...

Subject: [PATCH 00/14] clk_hw based clkdev/DT providers
Date: Mon,  8 Feb 2016 17:45:27 -0800
Message-Id: <1454982341-22715-1-git-send-email-sboyd@codeaurora.org>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

We've mostly split the clk API between consumers and providers
along struct clk and struct clk_hw, but the registration and
clkdev/DT code is still struct clk focused. This series
lays the foundation for changing that design by making
clk_register() return an int instead of a struct clk and
clkdev/DT lookups take a struct clk_hw instead of a struct clk.

After this series is applied, we can avoid using struct clk
in provider drivers entirely, unless we want to use the consumer
APIs. There are quite a few registration callers, so this change
will require converting all of them. I plan to do that gradually
over the coming weeks, but I've included a change to qcom
platforms because I could easily test it and show how things
will work.

The first two patches are cleanups to clkdev APIs that I found
while doing this work. I'd like to take those into clk-next
with the appropriate acks. They're mostly included because
they cause merge conflicts otherwise.

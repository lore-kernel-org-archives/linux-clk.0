I knew someone would raise that topic ;-)

syscon is a quick hack to be used when no clean solution exists. Sometimes 
implementing a proper API is just overkill, especially when the "system 
controller" aggregates registers that really belong to individual IP cores.

Proper abstract kernel APIs should of course be used wherever possible. Some 
system controllers are already supported in such a way, using the MFD 
subsystem and exposing proper APIs for part of their features, and letting 
drivers access registers directly for other features.

In the boot mode case I believe adding a new API would be both useful and 
quite simple, so I'd like to explore that option.

By the way, regarding the CA15/7 reset control registers, shouldn't they be 
exposed through the reset controller API ?

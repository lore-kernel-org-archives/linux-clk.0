Oh ok, it does make sense to enable as few clocks as possible.

However, even if we do not enable lots of clocks at that time, and this
helps to avoid the problem for now, it could still be that
someone/something requests a clock early during boot, leading to a PLL
enable... Shouldn't we make sure that those base clocks can be enabled
even during early boot..?

Thanks.

Interesting... I guess git describe is buggy then:

$ git describe --contains 80eeb1f0f757
v4.3-rc2~4^2~124
$ git log v4.3-rc1..v4.3-rc2 | grep 80eeb1f0f757
$ git log v4.2..v4.3-rc1 | grep 80eeb1f0f757
commit 80eeb1f0f757c790b020d9f425bb0e824973d49c
$ git describe --help
...
       --contains
           Instead of finding the tag that predates the commit, find the tag
           that comes after the commit, and thus contains it. Automatically
           implies --tags.

Looks fine, thanks.

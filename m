Documentation doesn't say much about that gate. I did few tests and TCON 
registers can be read and written even if TCON TOP TV TCON gate is disabled. 
However, there is no image, as expected.

More interestingly, I enabled test pattern directly in TCON to eliminate 
influence of the mixer. As soon as I disabled that gate, test pattern on HDMI 
screen was gone, which suggest that this gate influences something inside 
TCON.

Another test I did was that I moved enable/disable gate code to 
sun4i_tcon_channel_set_status() and it worked just as well.

I'll ask AW engineer what that gate actually does, but from what I saw, I 
would say that most appropriate location to enable/disable TCON TOP TV TCON 
gate is TCON driver. Alternatively, TCON TOP driver could check if any TV TCON 
is in use and enable appropriate gate. However, that doesn't sound right to me 
for some reason.

Best regards,
Jernej

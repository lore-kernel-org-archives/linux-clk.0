That commit isn't outside of clk tree :(

Because we're stabilizing the 4.9-rc series and not the 4.8-rc
series and the assumption is people tested code no 4.8 before it
was released. But in cases where that doesn't happen and the bugs
cause problems with testing the latest rc series we just apply
the patch. It sounds like in this case that happened, so I'll
move this patch over to fixes.

git grep "mmc-card" tells you more about where it's being parsed by
the mmc core.

I don't see any Xenon specific properties.

Instead I think it would make sense to update the generic
interpretation of the binding for mmc-card, as you have done here.

Rather not. Let's try to make the parsing of the child node for
mmc-card generic.

Absolutely an independent patch. Whether it can be done as a part of
mmc_of_parse() or whether we need yet another new mmc_of* API, we can
discuss.

My point is that, I don't this to be specific for Xenon (unless there
are specific reason, which I don't see here).

Well, then you need to learn more about how the mmc core works. In
this case, it shouldn't be too hard to implement.

Please, no.

If you find parts of the code that could be shared, we can probably
split those out into a file in lib/*.c and have that used by both
subsystems and potentially others as well.

I think these are all the ones that have a shared hardware block doing
both clocks and resets. My guess is that most other hardware does it
differently.

Your hardware seems to be in a third category, which is not uncommon
either: you have clocks, resets and additional registers all in a
single block without a structure around them.

You can handle this with purely syscon based abstraction, or you
can have a driver for the combined device that registers itself
to multiple subsystems in addition to being a syscon.

Thanks for working on this. The thermal sensor is very useful on
H3 because this SoC tends to be running rather hot at high clock
frequencies.

Do you also have plans for making use of an irq handler?

Can you elaborate on this? What's wrong with the dividers? Which clock
frequency happens to be used for THS in the end?

The H3 manual has some nice description of these registers and explains
how these parameters should be calculated (they depend on the THS clock
frequency). No magic involved.

Currently the H3 manual is available from Orange Pi people and OLIMEX.
There is also an open request about releasing it "officially":

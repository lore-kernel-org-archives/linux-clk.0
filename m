Subject: [PATCH 2/2] clk: at91: Fix for PLL set_rate changes not being
 actually written to PLL peripheral bits

When a USB device is connected to the USB host port on the SAM9N12 then
you get "-62" error which seems to indicate USB replies from the device
are timing out. Looking around, I saw the USB bus was running at half
speed. Going further, it seems that in ..._set_rate() the PLL wasn't
actually being adjusted. Writing the multiplier and divider values to
the peripheral fixes the bus running at half speed.

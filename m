protected_clocks_nr will be 0 on a !sunxi machine, so this is 
effectively a noop there.

This is only meant to solve the problems observed when trying to grab 
critical clocks before letting all the basic/OF clock types register. 
The actual clock trees are complete once all the built-in clock 
compatibles are probed, so this just pushes the protection after that 
point in time. The plan on the long term should be to use the 
CCF-built-in clock protection, once it's finished and merged, but it's 
not here yet.

Regarding your example, I'm not aware of any critical mod0 clocks (not 
that it should matter, as they won't be orphans either).

As I said, there shouldn't be any after all the built in clocks are probed.

That patch also moved the clock protection to arch_initcall btw :) You 
could say this is a subset of your patch. Moving everything to 
OF_CLK_DECLARE is unnecessary in my opinion, and it will also probably 
be slower (I see a bunch of extra of_match_nodes being run for every 
compatible)

As far as I know, rockchip SoCs are still suffering the breakage this 
set aims to fix :)

Thanks for the review!

Yeah, let's ignore a changing parent frequency. recalc_rate() is
also called when *this* clk rate is changed. The parent rate is
passed in because that's usually helpful to calculate the rate
that this op is supposed to return.

Can the DSP tell us what the rate of the clk is? Or what the rate
of the clk is configured for? What is that configuration out of
boot when it's OFF? Typically, recalc_rate() can tell us what the
rate of the clk is, even when its OFF, because we can read the
hardware and calculate the rate of the clk given the parent
frequency. We do have clk drivers out there that are like this
DSP and don't tell anything about the rate and we can't even ask.
In that case, we return 0 and cache the rate in the set_rate op.

Ideally, recalc_rate would always return the frequency of the clk
that's been configured in the hardware on the DSP side. If that
can't be done, I suppose faking it and caching the rate that the
set_rate op figures out would work. Or if enabling the clk let's
us know the rate we should cache it there too. But definitely
don't do any sort of rate caching in recalc_rate. It should just
blindly return the cached value if it can't read hardware.

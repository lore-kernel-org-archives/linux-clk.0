Subject: [PATCH V4 0/2] clk: bcm2835: use CLK_IS_CRITICAL/CLK_ENABLE_HAND_OFF
Date: Fri, 29 Apr 2016 17:42:34 +0000
Message-Id: <1461951756-16804-1-git-send-email-kernel@martin.sperl.org>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

From: Martin Sperl <kernel@martin.sperl.org>

The bcm2835 firmware enables several clocks and plls before
booting the linux kernel, when these later are claimed by a driver
(temporarily) and then released, then the corresponding plls are
disabled, which result in a crashed system.

Ideally we want to use CLK_ENABLE_HAND_OFF to mark those already
enabled clocks, but as CLK_ENABLE_HAND_OFF is not merged
yet this patchset takes a 2 setp approach:
In the first patch it first makes use of the - already in
clk-next - CLK_IS_CRITICAL.
The second patch will change the use to CLK_ENABLE_HAND_OFF,
which can get applied when the HAND_OFF patch-set goes in.

Martin Sperl (2):
  clk: bcm2835: mark enabled clocks with CLK_IS_CRITICAL
  clk: bcm2835: use CLK_ENABLE_HAND_OFF instead of CLK_IS_CRITICAL

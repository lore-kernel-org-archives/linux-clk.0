 Ok, with that being the case, there are two things here,

 1) If the device links are still intact at these places where unmap is called,
    then pm_runtime from the master would setup the all the clocks. That would
    avoid reintroducing the locking indirectly here.

 2) If not, then doing it here is the only way. But for both cases, since
    the unmap can be called from atomic context, resume handler here should
    avoid doing clk_prepare_enable , instead move the clk_prepare to the init.

One of the CCUs provided clock for two of the timers that are used as
clock sources.
Specifically this timer:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=143138193704763&w=2

Since the CGU provides the clock to the CCU which then again provides
the clock to the timer both must use CLK_OF_DECLARE for clk enable/get
rate to work in the timer driver.

It's is the CCU that uses the clocks from the CGU. So I think both
drivers needs to use CLK_OF_DECLARE.

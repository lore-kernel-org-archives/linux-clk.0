Unless I missed something in your patch, this comment says that, like
CLK_DIVIDER_MAX_AT_ZERO, CLK_DIVIDER_ZERO_GATE behave as a CLK_DIVIDER_ONE_BASED
clock

However, I don't see anything special done in _get_val() around
CLK_DIVIDER_ZERO_GATE which means that calling _get_val() with div=2 would give
val=1. This is more like a regular divider (when CLK_DIVIDER_ONE_BASED is not
set)

Also, when looking for the best divider, CCF could find that the best div is 1.
On a non-CLK_DIVIDER_ONE_BASED, this would translate to value 0 and
(accidentally) gate the clock .

all the occurrences of CLK_DIVIDER_ZERO_GATE I have seen in patch 9 are combined
with CLK_DIVIDER_ONE_BASED, which is probably why this potential issue has gone
unnoticed.

I think CLK_DIVIDER_ZERO_GATE should just means that value 0 gate the clock, and
just that. It should not imply what the rest of values mean.

In a more general way, I'd love to see a feature such as CLK_DIVIDER_ZERO_GATE
added to the divider but I'm bit concerned of all the quirks we are slowly
adding to the generic divider. It seems we are all trying re-use the algorithm
of clk_divider_bestdiv() with different 'val-to-div' transfer function. Not too
sure what the best solution could be though.

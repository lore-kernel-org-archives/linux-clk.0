Subject: [PATCH 0/5] clk: sunxi: Rework the clocks code to deal with orphans
Date: Tue,  2 Feb 2016 09:47:09 +0100

Hi everyone,

Here is an attempt at making the whole clk-sunxi code register the
clocks without creating any orphans by relying on CLK_OF_DECLARE.

This also has the net benefit of not having to add the SoC compatible
to the list of compatibles that trigger the clock registration, which
has started to be a pain.

I tested this on an A13 (R8 actually), everything seems to be working
just fine. I also tested it both with and without Heiko's patch to
defer clk_get if the clock is orphan, and previously broke everything.

Let me know what you think,
Maxime

Maxime Ripard (5):
  clk: sunxi: Make clocks setup functions return their clock
  clk: sunxi: Make clocks setup functions take const pointer
  clk: sunxi: convert current clocks registration to CLK_OF_DECLARE
  clk: sunxi: Remove old probe and protection code
  clk: sunxi: Remove clk_register_clkdev calls

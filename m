Yes, but lets leave that to after the current version is merged. That
way we have one kernel version which is just replacing the private clock
implementation and that will be good to bisect any regressions.
VPSS_CLK_CTRL for example is being set directly by the VPSS driver. That
driver will have to change too once we model the mux as a proper clock.

Okay.

Well the main thing I went with here is compatibility with existing code
which uses pll2_sysclk4. You are right that pll1_sysclk4 is probably a
better parent clock to model for the PSC. But, this will break existing
functionality as no one will be enabling pll2_sysclk4 then. And I
suspect that will break voice codec driver. The documentation for voice
codec does not seem to do a good job of explaining what the two clocks
are for. And without some thorough testing of voice codec (I have never
used it myself), I would just keep the functionality as-is.

I can add a comment on how the parent was arrived at though, so there is
some reference to when we look at this again.

The HDVICP is a subsystem in itself, so I am not so sure about that. The
problem here is compounded by the fact that some of these video
subsystems are not publicly documented. Here too, I think the safer
approach is to be compliant with existing code at least for one kernel
version. Otherwise, we run into the issue of too many things changing at
the same time making it tough to nail regressions.

we can add a comment here too on how the parent was arrived at (refer
back to existing code).

Thanks,
Sekhar

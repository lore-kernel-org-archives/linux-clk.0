Yes, this feature only works with CLK_DIVIDER_ONE_BASED in current design.
Probably we should state more clearly in the code comments?

It did not imply what the reset of values mean. User needs to specify the
correct divider types. For current case, it should be CLK_DIVIDER_ONE_BASED
only.
e.g.
000b - Clock disabled
001b - Divide by 1
010b - Divide by 2

If anymore divider type want to use it, then we need extend the support
accordingly.

Theoretically any type of divider gets a 0 val (register value) is invalid for
ZERO_GATE feature. We should avoid it.

IMHO CLK_DIVIDER_ZERO_GATE only indicates the 0 val means clk gate.
It does not assume divider types. That looks like a generic way and is exactly
what this patch intends to do. Does it make sense?

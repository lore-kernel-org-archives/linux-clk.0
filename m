Don't think so. Linus merged clk-next over the weekend. Either I applied
the patches in the wrong order, or you sent them in the wrong order. In
the future, please compile test each patch in isolation. I do that
sometimes, but not always as it's still a manual process for me. I need
to update my scripts to make that better, which I'll do shortly.

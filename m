Just got embarrassed with seeing that this changelog here actually
belongs into the previous patch :$

Thanks! I am relived to hear that (and hope that others agree as well
;-) If people are Ok with that approach I can do patches to move all
existing clock gates into one driver, but I guess this would be part of
a later series.

Cheers,
Andre.

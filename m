Hello All,

Sorry for longish delay but the exceptionally great summer in Finland
has kept me away from computer... Now when I am back from my travels
it's time to focus on patches again =)

Right. I'd better check that file then. Thanks for pointing it out.

I did rename this as I introduced new internal __clk_register_clkdev
(see below) - which is utilized by the clk_register_clkdev,
clk_hw_register_clkdev and devm_clk_hw_register_clkdev. This allowed
me to cut off some duplicated code from clk_register_clkdev and
clk_hw_register_clkdev.

(Mainly the:

	/*
	 * Since dev_id can be NULL, and NULL is handled specially, we must
	 * pass it as either a NULL format string, or with "%s".
	 */
if (dev_id) 
	... con_id, "%s", dev_id);
else
	... con_id, NULL);

parameter selection for old __clk_register_clkdev (which I renamed to
do_clk_register_clkdev).

So I tried to reduce code by deciding this only in the new wrapper
function __clk_register_clkdev. For me it was more obvioust that
__clk_register_clkdev would be next internal layer for clk_register_clkdev.
The old __clk_register_clkdev - which is now named as do_clk_register_clkdev
is the final layer doing lookup and registration.

This is code that earlier was duiplicated in both the
clk_register_clkdev and clk_hw_register_clkdev. I cleaned the code
duplication by adding this new __clk_register_clkdev function.

Right.

We could. But as I anyways introduced the new __clk_register_clkdev - in
order to slighly simplify clk_register_clkdev and clk_hw_register_clkdev
- it was convenient to not dublicate the IS_ERR chain and use the interal
__clk_register_clkdev -variant. And actually, I was not sure if it is
required to have some fast handling for the IS_ERR cases here and hence
I thought it should be checked before devres_alloc. But if there is no
need for priorizing this check - then I would remove IS_ERR checks from
devm_clk_hw_register_clkdev and clk_hw_register_clkdev and do it only in the
__clk_register_clkdev. Unfortunately we need to keep it in
clk_register_clkdev because this must be checked before we do
__clk_get_hw(clk). Anyways, that would further simplify this to something
like (untested, not even compiled code below which is only meant to explain
what I mean):

static int __clk_register_clkdev(struct clk_hw *hw, struct clk_lookup **cl,
				 const char *con_id, const char *dev_id)
{
	if (IS_ERR(hw))
		return PTR_ERR(hw);

	if (dev_id)
		*cl = do_clk_register_clkdev(hw, con_id, "%s",
                                           dev_id);
        else
                *cl = do_clk_register_clkdev(hw, con_id, NULL);

        return (*cl) ? 0 : -ENOMEM;


int clk_register_clkdev(struct clk *clk, const char *con_id,
        const char *dev_id)
{
	int rval;
	struct clk_lookup *cl;

	if (!IS_ERR(clk))
		return __clk_register_clkdev(__clk_get_hw(clk), &cl, con_id, dev_id);

	return PTR_ERR(clk);	
}

int clk_hw_register_clkdev(struct clk_hw *hw, const char *con_id,
        const char *dev_id)
{
	int rval;
	struct clk_lookup *cl;
	return __clk_register_clkdev(hw, con_id, &cl, dev_id);
}

int devm_clk_hw_register_clkdev(struct device *dev, struct clk_hw *hw,
                                const char *con_id, const char *dev_id)
{
        struct clk_lookup **cl;
	int rval = -ENOMEM;

        if (IS_ERR(hw))
                return PTR_ERR(hw);

        cl = devres_alloc(devm_clkdev_release, sizeof(*cl), GFP_KERNEL);
        if (cl) {
                rval = __clk_register_clkdev(hw, cl, con_id, dev_id);
                if (!rval)
                        devres_add(dev, cl);
                else
                        devres_free(cl);
        }
        return rval;
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(devm_clk_hw_register_clkdev);

or do you prefer that I do not touch the existing clk_register_clkdev
and clk_hw_register_clkdev at all and only add
devm_clk_hw_register_clkdev? If that's what you prefer we can go with it
too. I just think doing the 

if (dev_id) 
	... con_id, "%s", dev_id);
else
	... con_id, NULL);

selection only in one function makes this cleaner.

I can remove this.

The clk-fixes branch is for patches that fix problems in code
merged during the merge window as well as small one-liners and
things that are causing great pain for people on the latest
release. Given that this fixes a regression in v4.8 and we're
trying to stabilize v4.9 it looked like it could wait until
v4.10.

So is there something going on here where the pain is too much to
wait for the next merge window? If so the commit text should
mention something about what's causing that pain. Perhaps by
referencing the commit that merged outside of clk tree that
caused problems.

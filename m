Finally got around to test this. Above example had some issues, or I
am doing something wrong.

First of, the address parser does not seem to like that #size-cells =
<0> when ranges are empty. Got following warning from device tree
compiler:
Warning (ranges_format): /nor@70009000 has empty "ranges" property but
its #size-cells (0) differs from / (1)

and on boot:
[    0.399357] prom_parse: Bad cell count for /nor@70009000/bus@0

Got it to work if I changed to (also had to add an empty ranges prop
in bus node):

gmi@70009000 {
    #address-cells = <1>;
    #size-cells = <1>;
    ranges;

    bus@0,0 {
                compatible = "simple-bus";
                reg = <0 0>;
                ranges;

                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <1>;

                can@48000000 {
                    reg = <0x48000000 0x100>;
                    ...
                };


                can@48040000 {
                    reg = <0x48040000 0x100>;
                    ...
                };
}

But I wonder is there something wrong with below example (which does
work), that is omitting the bus node:

gmi@70009000 {
    #address-cells = <1>;
    #size-cells = <1>;
    ranges;

    can@48000000 {
        reg = <0x48000000 0x100>;
        ...
    };

    can@48040000 {
        reg = <0x48040000 0x100>;
        ...
    };
}

Just feel that I need to duplicate information if add an bus node.

Best Regards,
Mirza

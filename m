If we are talking about HW divider, it is 8 (216 / 27 = 8).

Slightly offtopic, reason why DE2 is hardcoded to 432 might be that for 4K 
resolution you need at least 297 MHz. So next dividable frequency is taken 
(432 MHz). That way you can have 4K HDMI display and composite TV connected at 
the same time, although this sounds a bit weird.

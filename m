Subject: [PATCH v4 0/2] mark spi clocks as critical and enable spi3 clocks

Hi,

I managed to bring some confusion on these two patches, but
finally I managed to find the right solution (which is similar to
the patch version 2).

The real issue was hidden in the spi bus as reported in the
following patch:

  https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/7/7/81

This patch in principle replaces the clock_ignore_unused flags in
for the spi and enables the spi3 that in the tm2(e) board will be
connected to the IR remote controller.

Changelog:

V1 -> V2
 - the "sclk_spi3" doesn't need to be enabled in boot time as it
  is handled by the spi driver itself.

 - use the CLK_IS_CRITICAL flag for the ioclk

V2 -> V3
 - some more tests has confirmed taht "sclk_spi1,3" need to be
   enabled as critical!

 - added Chanwoo's review in the second commit.

V3 -> V4
 - patch V3 was wrong, back to patch v2.

 - reworded the commit of patch no. 1

Thanks,
Andi

This part is covered. As mentioned above, the phase clks will return
-ENOTSUPP if the mmc clk is set in the new timing mode. The MMC driver
would try getting the current phase, check if it fails, and if it does,
realizes the clk is in new timing mode, and will switch the mmc controller
to it as well. I think this semantic fits the hardware well enough,
though it might be confusing without the accompanying comments.

See this commit for an example on how it should work.

I admit this is not taken care of in this patch. Mostly because there
is no existing DT for the A83T to cater to. For the H3 and other SoCs
that do, we need some way of asking the CCU to switch the mode.

IIRC the output and sample clocks do not support a phase delay of 0.
So what if we design the semantic for this class of clocks as, if
phase == 0, switch to new timing mode, otherwise use old timing mode?
That would allow us to support this without adding extra functions,
and kind of matches what the hardware does. If you're using the new
timing mode, the delays in the mmc clk are bypassed.

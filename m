yeah, I was (and somewhat still am) debating on the dt vs. clk driver 
positioning. As you can see, there are multiple sources, most of them are 
somewhat questionable. I.e. apll and dpll are the cpu + ddr supplies and we 
will want to do ddr-scaling at some point too.

So the gpll really is the only really sane option and I guess simply doing it 
in the driver (similar to what rk3188 does) might be better.
If some boards really want to select a different source, they then can do that 
via assigned-clocks in the board-dts.

The register address for clk enable and bit mask are not used by any
other driver. But I'd like to keep all the register addresses in one
enum. That eases checking changes when new chips come.

The private data for MFD (which contains for example the regmap and chip
type) are required by other drivers too.

Currently clk only uses regmap directly from the struct bd718xx. But I
would like to have the access to chip_type as well. And even if we forget
the chip_type. Well, I only see two bad ways of omitting the struct
bd718xx:

1. Always keep the regmap as first member in parent device's driver_data.
Then we can just get the driver data and do cast to regmap. I am not fan
of this as it breaks as fast as someone changes the struct bd718xx - and
as this is part of MFD - well, there is no guarantees the clk people are
even reviewing such change. Also if we need the chip type we are back
using the struct.

2. Use some regmnap wrapper functions which would only take the parent
dev pointer and dig out the regmap details. This would be doable but
then we still have dependency to these wrappers (so dependency is not
solved). Additionally these wrappers are something we decided to get rid
of few patch versions ago.

I don't expect much renamings to take place after the latest patch set
to MFD/regulator tree has been applied. So maybe the clk patch set can
just wait untill MFD/regulator stuff gets integrated. I would be
gratefull if we could review the clk patch set already now though so I
could do improvements/changes to clk side while waiting for
MFD/regulator to get applied. Also, the devm_ functions (patch 1) are
not depending on MFD - so maybe we can get them reviewed/applied? If I
have the spare time I can look if I can clean up some of those not freed
clkdev lookups.

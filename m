Please do not use C++-style comments, use /* comment */ instead.

You hardcode the PLL ID here. What if this function if called for PLLA?

You should use PLL_MUL_MASK(layout) and PLL_DIV_MASK to do that.

This is wrong. The clk has the CLK_SET_RATE_GATE set, which means the
rate cannot be updated if the PLL is not gated, and if you look at
clk_pll_prepare(), you'll see that div and mul fields are updated
there. Now, maybe there's a bug in clk_pll_prepare(), but
clk_pll_set_rate() is definitely not the place where we want ->div and
->mul to be written to the register.

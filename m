If we agree, I can send the following three patches.


[1] Add "depends on HAS_IOMEM"
    to all drivers selecting MFD_SYSCON
    (Unmet dependencies will be fixed by this)

[2] For consistency, convert existing "depends on MFD_SYSCON"
    to "select MFD_SYSCON" + "depends on HAS_IOMEM"

[3] Change MFD_SYSCON to user-unconfigurable option.
    But, for COMPILE_TEST, allow users to enable it independently.
    Like follows:

    config MFD_SYSCON
        bool "System Controller Register R/W Based on Regmap" if COMPILE_TEST
        select REGMAP_MMIO
        help
          Select this option to enable accessing system control registers
          via regmap.


Is this OK?

Well, good suggestions to me.
It makes the implementation of this clock type more comprehensive.

It seems we still need keep CLK_DIVIDER_ZERO_GATE to distinguish with other=
s.

The change for recacle_rate may looks like:
diff --git a/drivers/clk/clk-divider.c b/drivers/clk/clk-divider.c
index f78ba7a..7364ac4 100644
--- a/drivers/clk/clk-divider.c
+++ b/drivers/clk/clk-divider.c
@@ -125,8 +125,9 @@ unsigned long divider_recalc_rate(struct clk_hw *hw, un=
signed long parent_rate,
=20
        div =3D _get_div(table, val, flags, divider->width);
        if (!div) {
+               if ((flags & CLK_DIVIDER_ZERO_GATE) && clk_hw_is_enabled(hw=
))
+                       return divider->cached_rate;
+
                WARN(!(flags & CLK_DIVIDER_ALLOW_ZERO),
                        "%s: Zero divisor and CLK_DIVIDER_ALLOW_ZERO not se=
t\n",
                        clk_hw_get_name(hw));

And for the initial disabled state (div =3D 0), the calc_rate will still re=
turn
0 rate as there's still no set_rate happened.

If any issue, please let me know.

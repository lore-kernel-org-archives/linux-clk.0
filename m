I can rework the patches to do that if you prefer.

This being said, I already had a similar issue with atmel clocks [1],
where a peripheral requires a specific rate and the periph clk can
take its source from 2 different PLLs: one that is widely used by other
peripherals and which cannot be modified and the other which is not so
widely used and can be customized to generate the rate we need.
Maybe that's something we should address with a generic solution at
some point: clk constraint propagation, clk rate lock or something
else (Mike mentioned another approach here [1]).

In the meantime, the patch here should do the trick for the bcm2835
platform.

The roles of the bus gate and the clock gate are the same. I don't see
any reason to set one gate without setting the other one. More, the
spec says what the bus gate must be enabled before the clock gate (and
reverse order while disabling). So, setting both gates in one function
call seems safer.

Then, if you want to save some power while not playing anything, just do
clk_disable() of the (main and only) i2s clock.

Definitely, I'm also tired of writing the patches ;-)

I think they are all caught implicitly, otherwise I would have run
into them.

I sent a patch for this on Feb 14 and again March 13, but haven't
gotten around to resubmit again.

An alternative would be to remove all the dependencies as 'lib-y'
in the Makefile and remove the individual Kconfig symbols. That
way, we would always build all of them when CONFIG_SUNXI_CCU
is enabled, but the linker would drop the ones that do not get
referenced.

I wouldn't expect there to be a need for a common firmware API for
firmwares that don't implement some common standard (such as ACPI),
since the operations supported by the firmwares will be
firmware-specific, and hence not be amenable to generic clients (a
client of the raspberrypi,firmware object may "translate" it to standard
APIs such as clock, power domains, etc., while allowing other clients
access to all the custom features). As such, I expect using a generic
property name here isn't that useful.

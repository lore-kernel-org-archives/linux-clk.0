Hi Chen-Yu,

thanks for the answer!

Right, I should have checked this before ...

I was hoping that it just provides clocks to any users (drivers) and
wouldn't bother with tinkering with every clock unless explicitly being
asked for (by a driver being pointed to a specific clock through DT).
So it would need to iterate through anything - neither the whole DT nor
it's own list of clocks.

I am totally OK with that: Any potential Linux THS driver can take over,
if the DT references this device and the clock.
My point is that atm there is no such driver and so the clocks framework
shouldn't turn that clock off.

Unfortunately the THS is always unsecure. And even if it could be
switched, after a recent IRC discussion I came to believe that those
secure peripherals features only works when the secure boot feature is
used, which requires to blow an efuse and thus is not easily doable on
most boards and also irreversible.
Also I am not sure whether this security feature actually extends to the
mod clocks and the bus reset and clock gates bits.

But I was relying on that Linux doesn't touch hardware that's not
referenced in the DT, so if firmware uses the THS, any Linux THS node
would need to go - or the other way around: if there is a Linux THS
node, firmware backs off.

Yes, I was thinking about that, but it indeed sounds like a hack to
follow this.

Good point, but indeed looks like a debug feature.

Which I am fine with. If people are desperate about a THS driver, this
could take over, although I would expect a firmware driving the THS
would discourage this - for instance by removing a THS node.

OK, thanks for the pointer, I will look into this direction.

Andre.

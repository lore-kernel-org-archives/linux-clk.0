So to recap, you want mmc2_clk without the new pre-dividers here.
Then we add them for _all_ SoCs that have the old/new mode switch
at the same time. Is that correct?

This really isn't A83T specific code. It's just one way to handle
the extra divider for the new timing mode. Obviously we will add the
functions to query and set the timing mode bit, but that will be
generic. If you want all code related to the new mode in one patch,
then I understand.

Subject: [RFC PATCH] clk: meson: gxbb: remove the "cpu_clk"
Date: Sun, 26 Mar 2017 13:06:02 +0200
Message-Id: <20170326110602.23379-1-martin.blumenstingl@googlemail.com>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

It seems that the "cpu_clk" was carried over from the meson8b clock
controller driver. On Meson GX (GXBB/GXL/GXM) the registers which are
used by the cpu_clk have a different purpose (in other words: they don't
control the CPU clock anymore). HHI_SYS_CPU_CLK_CNTL1 bits 31:24 are
reserved according to the public S905 datasheet, while bit 23 is the
"A53_trace_clk_DIS" gate (which according to the datasheet should only
be used in case a silicon bug is discovered) and bits 22:20 are a
divider (A53_trace_clk). The meson clk-cpu code however expects that
bits 28:20 are reserved for a divider (according to the public S805
datasheet this "SCALE_DIV: This value represents an N+1 divider of the
input clock.").

The CPU clock on Meson GX SoCs is provided by the SCPI DVFS clock
driver instead. Two examples from a Meson GXL S905X SoC:
- vcpu (SCPI DVFS clock 0) rate: 1000000000 / cpu_clk rate: 708000000
- vcpu (SCPI DVFS clock 0) rate: 1512000000 / cpu_clk rate: 708000000

Unfortunately the CLKID_CPUCLK was already exported (but is currently
not used) to DT.

This is an RFC because I would like to hear other people's opinion on
how to clean up the CLKID_CPUCLK (as it leaves a "hole" in
gxbb_hw_onecell_data and changes the DT API (by removing a currently
unused #define).

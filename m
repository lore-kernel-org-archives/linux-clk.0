The Allwinner Timings Controller has two, mutually exclusive, channels.
When the binding has been introduced, it was assumed that there would be
only a single user per channel in the system.

While this is likely for the channel 0 which only connects to LCD displays,
it turns out that the channel 1 can be connected to multiple controllers in
the SoC (HDMI and TV encoders for example). And while the simultaneous use
of HDMI and TV outputs cannot be achieved, switching from one to the other
at runtime definitely sounds plausible.

Add an extra property, allwinner,tcon-channel, to specify for a given
endpoint which TCON channel it is connected to, while falling back to the
previous mechanism if that property is missing.

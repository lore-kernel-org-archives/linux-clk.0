Not much apart from the usual driver skeleton. Also SCPI specification
will not be enhanced any further while SCMI will be. So they will
deviated in the feature set going further. Even I was thinking of
merging then together initially but based on some WIP changes to the
specification, I thought it may not be good idea. But if we think it can
be merged in future , I will do that for sure(for easy maintenance)

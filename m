Yes agreed on the point that meaning of "cpuidle" differs on each SoC.

Interesting, at-least ETMv4 or some other coresight specification
clearly classify the power domains and the register access. The actual
power domain itself may vary depending on implementation.

Agreed, but can we start supporting the sane designs in sane way first.
We can always add compatible and handle deviations. I agree we may need
to support such deviations but starting with that seems setting a bad
example.

Agreed. But my point is that many issues are around cpuidle and some
usecase and just eliminating that use-case sounds bad. For me,
core-sight was most useful to debug issues around cpu power management
and lockups where we can't stop cores but examine these registers.
There are other alternatives for other use-cases IMO.

We can always do that unconditionally. If implementations don't honor
those bits, it's different. If they hang on accessing something which is
on debug power domain and not on core power domain, then you have much
bigger issue to solve. How can you even trust and make any other
register accesses that are in debug power domain then ?

Again it's completely platform specific. All you need to care is that
the debug power domain is on or not. Disabling CPUIdle to achieve that
is simply wrong and may work only on few platforms.

Thanks

Please don't *misuse* nohlt to disable idle. There are other ways to
do the same either from the user-space or from the driver.

Also consider with cpuidle enabled ;). I can help testing if needed.

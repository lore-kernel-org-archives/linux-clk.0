So one issue I run into trying to move the clk_get() to during attach is,
most of these GDSCs to which we are associating the mmagic clocks are
votable and some of them happen to be ON when the gdsc driver probes.

And we have this to handle the situation..

        /*
         * Votable GDSCs can be ON due to Vote from other masters.
         * If a Votable GDSC is ON, make sure we have a Vote.
         */
        if ((sc->flags & VOTABLE) && on)
                gdsc_enable(&sc->pd);

And now since we defer clk_get() to a later point, the gdsc
can't really be enabled along with the enable/voting of the 
associated clocks.

I was thinking we do something like this instead,

	/*
	 * Votable GDSCs can be ON due to Vote from other masters.
	 * If *we* haven't Voted for it, tell genpd its actually OFF.
	 */
	if ((sc->flags & VOTABLE) && on)
		on = !on;

What do you think?

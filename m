Ah, right.  I think this gets back to your series:

  8993791 [RFC,1/3] clk: fix inconsistent use of req_rate
  8993801 [RFC,2/3] clk: adjust clocks to their requested rate after
parent changes
  8993811 [RFC,3/3] clk: rockchip: make rk3399 vop dclks keep their
rate on parent rate changes

Did you ever have any more ideas about that?  I think the last thing
in that series was a comment from me on patch #2/3.  If we can't come
up with a general CCF solution for this problem, perhaps we need to
register for notifications for all the relevant clocks that might
change?

Yes they are. Some devices, such as UARTs and I2C controllers, need
to get the clock rate of the gate and calculate the proper internal
divider.

This is somewhat misleading. What "clock" registers are you referring
to? There are no "bus" registers. The reason we call them "bus clock
gates" is because they are mashed together, instead of having clearly
separated registers for each AHB/APB bus.

And if you want just a generic clock gates driver, we already have
the "simple-gates" driver.

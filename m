Yes, actually we have already tried this way before to fix the issue
that don't gate parent clock in HW if any child is on during booting phase.
e.g. Clock A and B, B is child of A.
Both A and B clock are enabled in HW in bootloader.

Driver A probe:
clk_prepare_enable(A) -> clk_disable_unprepare(A)
In disable operation, clock framework finds there's a child B is on,
so framework will not gate clock A by calling ops->disable(), but instead,
only de-reference the enable_count, although it's enable_count becomes 0.
Then both A and B are still kept on in HW but not in clock tree state.

Later the clk_disable_unused feature in clock framework will gate those unused
clocks, both A and B, both HW and SW clock tree state are consistent.

We've tested this approach can work, but comparing to the approach we
finally used in this patch series, it has a few disadvantages:
1) The definition of the API clk_disable and clk_unprepare becomes a bit
slightly different from current one, it needs take count of the child clock
state while currently not.
2) It's more complicated and require more code changes.
3) more power consumption although not big deal
4) Manually create inconsistent state between HW and clock tree during
booting may be not good choice.

So we intend to the approach in this patch series that enable parent clock
during clk_disable_unused and disable it again if the clock type requires.
It's simple and easy understand.

Our hardware needs the parent clock on for all clock settings,
parent switch, rate change and even clock enable/disable, that's
why we met issues that system will hang when disabling clock B
while its parent A is off in clk_disable_unused during booting.

The .set_rate_and_parent won't work for our issue, it's only used
if reparent during change rate. And it only enables both parents
if the clock itself is on.

But you reminder me that the MX7D clock setting registers in target
interface has clock enable/mux/divider in one regiser.
That means we do can implement .set_rate_and_parent later.
It can be an improvement.

Okay, Will use it.

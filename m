Really not a problem at all.  The OSTIMER0 is required for the system
tick, and if that's not present, the kernel will be without any kind
of time keeping, so a missing watchdog driver is the least of the
problems.

Therefore, both PXA and SA11x0 register their clocks really early to
ensure that OSTIMER0 is available by the time_init() stage, which is
way before driver probe time.

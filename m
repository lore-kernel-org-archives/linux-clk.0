They are not the same. AFAIK, CLK_SET_RATE_GATE tells the clk framework
that this clk's rate cannot be changed if it is enabled (which means
some one is using it). However the clk framework does nothing to
actually handle it. It just returns an error. Any consumers are
responsible for gating the clock before making changes. This is a nice
thing to have, as it can prevent unintended changes to dot clocks or
audio clocks used with active output streams. We could consider setting
this for the audio and video PLLs.

Here we are dealing with the CPU PLL, which, for practical reasons,
is always enabled as far as the clk framework is concerned. The
reason being the OPPs are never low enough for the CPU clock to
use any other parent. To have it disabled, we would have to kick
consumers (the CPU clock in this case) to use other clocks, so it's
safe, remember which ones we kicked, and then bring them back once
everything is done.

AFAIK, we, samsung, rockchip, meson, do the temporary reparenting
using clk_notifiers to access the mux registers directly. As far
as the clk framework is concerned, nothing has changed.

I'm not saying it's not possible to support this in the core, but
the core already has to do a lot of bookkeeping and recalculation
when anything changes. Adding something transient into the process
isn't helping. And the reparenting might temporarily violate any
downstream requirements.

For now, I think clk notifiers is the easier solution for these
one off requirements that are pretty much contained in a small
part of the system.

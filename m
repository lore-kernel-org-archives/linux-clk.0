The problem is, you can't just add the clkctrl clock nodes themselves 
alone, as this introduces the problem that any clocks with no users will 
get disabled => causes a boot time hang when all the device clocks get 
shut down.

If you want to delay the usage of the clocks until you have interconnect 
target modules in place, you need to introduce the clock nodes also at 
that point, similar to what needs to be done now to squash patch #8 or #9.

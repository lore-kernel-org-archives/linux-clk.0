It looks like it is:
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/driver=
s/ata/Makefile

Maybe not the linker itself, but the build system seems to handle that
just fine.

Hmmm, ok.

Then maybe we can just have a flag to say wether p is a power of two
or not, just like the clock framework itself.

Ok, feel free to post some patches doing this, and we will see then :)

This is not supported by the clk core though. Rather, the clk core just
provides the helper function of_clk_detect_critical() to set the flag.
We don't support it either. Furthermore, the function's comment says:

    Do not use this function. It exists only for legacy Device Tree
    bindings, such as the one-clock-per-node style that are outdated.
    Those bindings typically put all clock data into .dts and the Linux
    driver has no clock data, thus making it impossible to set this flag
    correctly from the driver. Only those drivers may call
    of_clk_detect_critical from their setup functions.

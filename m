I had a look here, and they appear to be much more complex than I
need. The qcom directory is 41000 lines of code! The moxart driver is
similar to what we do, but as you mentioned it is not arranged how you
want it.

In the fourth generation parts, such as the ast2400, we have this layout:

    clock                rate
 -----------------------------
  clk_clkin          48000000
     clk_hpll       384000000
        clk_apb      48000000

clkin is the oscillator that may be running at 24, 25 or 48MHz. We can
determine this from the strapping register.

The hpll divisor is controlled by strapping resistors, and indicated
in the strapping register.

The apb is controlled by a register in the SCU, the Aspeed's
bucket-of-bits for controlling various parts of the soc.

In our case we want don't need to adjust any clocks. We do want struct
clk's so attached device drivers to know how fast they are being
clocked. How do you see this laid out?

Cheers,

Joel

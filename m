Is it correct to remove clk_core_reparent()? It lacks
__clk_recalc_accuracies() and __clk_recalc_rates(), so the new parent's
rate will not propagate correctly.

For example, I set vdec_sel as a critical clock. Without your patch, the
result was:

    vdecpll         0            0   338000000
       vdecpll_ck   1            1   338000000
          vdec_sel  1            1   338000000

With your patch, it became:

    vdecpll         1            1   338000000
       vdecpll_ck   1            1           0
          vdec_sel  1            1           0

The prepare_count and enable_count are correct with your patch, but the
rates of vdecpll_ck and vdec_sel become incorrect.

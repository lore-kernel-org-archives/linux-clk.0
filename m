That's good idea, index with shift and width will do as prediv can be variable.

Adjusting rate in generic clk_factors_recalc_rate, with prediv shift
and width is straight forward, and we can remove recalc function
itself, currently it's used only for a31 ahb1.

I'm doubtful about getter, In sun6i_get_ahb1_factors we still need to
pass req->prediv_width instead of req->parent_index.

I'll send separate patch for this prediv handling.

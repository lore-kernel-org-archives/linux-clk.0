I'm just about to send my series of patches which would add full support for 
UI and VI planes (multi planes, HW scaling, all color formats). It would clash 
with your patches 6, 7 and 8.

Preview of my work as a single patch can be seen here:
https://github.com/jernejsk/linux-1/commit/
8fdef3b510b567bfe81c87b0c3e73ddcf4f5b711

How would you like to handle that? Some changes are similar, but I don't see a 
point rebasing my patches atop of yours.

Since I'm almost done, I will just send them and we can discuss them then.

Best regards,
Jernej

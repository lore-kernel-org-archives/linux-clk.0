Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] ARM: imx31: clock initialization fixes
Date: Mon, 26 Sep 2016 03:03:39 +0300
Message-Id: <1474848223-19728-1-git-send-email-vz@mleia.com>
List-ID: <linux-clk.vger.kernel.org>

The change is tested on qemu kzm target and mx31lite board, while both
targets don't have DTS in upstream, I had to write simple DTS files for
them, because the proposed change is for i.MX31 targets with OF support.

i.MX31/OF/clock initialization seems to be broken currently, if
the series is not applied I can not get a working clock source during
early boot stage on a board with DTB supplied.

Changes from v1 to v2, thanks to Uwe and Stephen for review:
* added one more new fix in imx31.dtsi which moves CCM device node
  to AIPS2 bus,
* included to the series a fix of CCM interrupts in imx31.dtsi,
  the change was sent as a separate patch, the change is included
  to avoid a patch application dependency,
* as suggested by Uwe reworded one of the commits removing "stack
  corruption" mentioning, the overwritten value is passed in a register,
* as suggested by Uwe squashed clk-imx31.c and imx31-dt.c changes
  to avoid a runtime problem if only one of two patches are applied

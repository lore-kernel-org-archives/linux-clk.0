Subject: [PATCH 00/34] Convert clk providers to clk_hw based APIs (part 1)

This is an initial set of patches to convert clk provider
drivers over to the clk_hw based approach of registering clks.
The foundational part of that has merged into v4.7-rc1 (see commit
58657d189a2f and it's children for details), so this series updates
some drivers for the new registration style. Not all drivers are
converted because this takes quite some time, but this should be
a good chunk of it.

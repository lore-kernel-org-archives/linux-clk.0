Do you think that devm_ is overkill, given we will never unload this driver?

Can you explain why you suggest to construct the structures directly
instead of using the APIs?

I had a read of the basic type registration functions, and the
relevant failure paths are memory allocation failures. If we're out of
memory that early in boot then things have gone pretty bad.

I can add checks for null and bail out; I don't think there's value in
freeing the allocated memory: if a system can't load it's clock driver
then it's super hosed.

Thanks for the review. I fixed all of the other things you mentioned.

Cheers,

Joel
